module.exports = `Pope Francis lands in Washington, D.C., Tuesday afternoon and kicks off a packed three-city tour through the nations capital, New York City and Philadelphia.
TheBlaze asked people outside Philly landmarks like Independence Hall and iconic cheesesteak restaurants Genos and Pats, If you could ask Pope Francis one question, what would it be?

Lets talk about the 800-pound gorilla in the room. No politician will touch it and no citizen wants to acknowledge it in an era where political correctness has run amok.
But we have to.

It is Europes desperate refugee crisis. Its a truly global situation, the seriousness of which is unparalleled in modern times.
Put simply, its the largest single human movement in Europe since World War II and a religio-sociographic earthquake the likes of which the world hasnt seen for centuries.

Ultimately, the situation can be a good one.
Thats because adept, intelligent politicians can turn social, political, and economic risks into opportunity. Migrants, for example, can backfill an aging European labor pool, are ready to work, and can help by raising overall birth rates to shore up a shaky demographic pyramid.
Wharton University Professor Robert Meyer notes that refugee immigration can have long-term positives. The highly skilled start businesses while the lower skilled or no-skilled take jobs locals dont want. Thats what happened in the 1960s when Fidel Castro sent people packing for the United States. Today, Meyer observes, at least 40 percent of the start-ups in Silicon Valley have an immigrant as a founder.
But this is where things get tricky.
Like many people, I am hard-pressed to use intelligent and politician in the same sentence these days. A positive outcome is dependent on positive people.
Right now, Europe is a stunted mess, and its citizens, like our own, feel economically insecure. Many are still reeling from the global Financial Crisis of 2008-2009.
Citizen trust is at or near the bottom of the barrel when it comes to entrenched political leaders. If even a single Syrian refugee commits an act of terrorism, theres going to be hell to pay politically. Not surprisingly, nationalist sentiment is building.
Over the short term, this will be played out as humanitarian concerns collide with austerity policies, housing needs, and integration. Already strained public finances are going to get crushed. Thats not yet registered for most people.
If Europe is to survive, its self-interested officials have to involve business leaders and private finance in making rapid policy changes. Thats because business leaders are far more direct than political apparatchiks.
They will make decisions based on skills, benefits, and training needs that by their very definition involve a level of segregation. Critics will call foul based on the apparent discrimination, much the way they have lined up against Donald Trumps position on Mexican immigration. Theyre not the same thing.
One is an economic/humanitarian need while the other is a security risk. Countries that have refused to engage abroad are now going to bear the brunt of that failure. Germany and America, for example, still do not grasp that inaction has led to direct battlefield escalation.
Theres also a corresponding danger inside Europe itself from sleeper agents using millions of refugees as cover for hijrah or immigration jihad. Islamic State has openly threatened to flood Europe with 500,000 fake refugees, and unlike President Barack Obamas red line, chances are they mean it.
I am not surprised that the Bulgarian State Agency for National Security, for example, is already investigating five men  refugees  caught at the Gyueshevo checkpoint with decapitation videos, jihadist prayers, and Islamic State propaganda on their phones. More will follow.
Its worth noting that not a single Gulf States nation has taken in refugees, citing that the risk of terrorism is too high, even as Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey have accommodated an estimated 3 million people. Evidently they know something Europe doesnt or simply doesnt yet have the stomach to admit.
There is no concept of burden sharing, notes Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Human Rights Watch for the Middle East and Africa. The Saudi, Emirati and Qatari approach has been to sign a check and let everyone else deal with it, she says. Even so, according to Breitbart, Britain has already donated more than Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar combined, throwing in more than 920 million versus a collective 589 million.
Meanwhile, Greece, Italy, and France are merely acting as conduits and sending desperate people onward. Hungary, Austria, and Germany have clamped down as I write this.
At the end of the day, you can call it Islamophobia, unadulterated racism, or even xenophobia, but the net result is the same  a massive economic impact at a time when Europe is almost totally unprepared to handle a rolling parade of desperation.
Making matters worse, we are talking about potentially millions of people who, by their own admission, are not culturally compatible and who are showing very little if any desire to fit in to the millennia-old civilization Europe enjoys today.
To put this in perspective, Eurostat reports that the EU never settled more than 7,400 refugees a year between 2008 and 2014, despite having a population of 507 million. The United States with a population of 330 million settles only an average of 66,000 refugees a year.
More poignantly, approximately 516,219 non-EU citizens are ordered to return home each year and, not surprisingly, less than half do.
The staggering numbers involved here suggest a sobering truth:
Everything from womens rights, to law, to intellectual freedom  concepts brought forth in the Age of Enlightenment dating from the 1620s to roughly the 1780s  is at risk.

Parents of students at a Florida middle school are upset over a science assignment that suggested if someone told them evolution was just a theory, as a way of dismissing it, [...] they are trying to mislead you.
Image source: WKMG-TV
The assignment given to 8th grade students atHeritage Middle School titled Not Just a Theory was meant to teach students current science standards for differentiating scientific theory and scientific law, a letter sent home to parents explained, according to WKMG-TV.
But some parents, like Jennifer Flinchum,who saw the assignment and how it was worded said it caused a heated reaction.
The hair on the back of my neck stood up, she told the news station.
LisaMcNeil told WKMG it wasnt necessarily the topic of evolution but just the way they phrased those few sentences how they were kind of taking the rights away from the parents.
Heres what the assignment said:
Next time someone tries to tell you that evolution is just a theory, as a way of dismissing it, as if its just something someone guessed at, remember that theyre using the non-scientific meaning of the word. If that person is a teacher, or minister, or some other figure of authority, they should know better. In fact, they probably do, and are trying to mislead you.
WKMG reported that after parents started balking at the assignment, the school issued an apology letter.
Recently in 8th grade science assignment titled Not just a theory, was distributed in an attempt to address current science standards for differentiating scientific theory and scientific law, the letter stated, according to WKMG. The reading does meet this criterion up until the last two sentences that state, If that person is a teacher, or minister, or some other figure of authority, they should know better In fact, they probably do, and are trying to mislead you.
Upon this coming to our knowledge, the lesson had been retracted, the letter continued. In fact, please know that we apologize for this resource being used and take comfort knowing that it will not be used again. At no time, is it our place to interfere with authorities of household beliefs. Should you like to discuss this further then please do not hesitate to contact me.
Flinchum told WKMG that this incident makes her question what else theyre going to put in front of her son this year.


Last night I had a dream that America changed overnight.
I didnt know what had happened, but everything was different when I woke up (still in my dream).

The sky and atmosphere were different. There was a sense of clarity, of transparency.
Photo Credit: Reuters

I walked into town, and wait till you see what I found
People Were Thriving in This Fed-Free America
Everywhere I looked, everybody was working and smiling.
There was a bank on every corner. None of them had walls. There were young and old bankers greeting everyone passing by. They knew everybody and everybody knew them.
They were giving away toasters and offering low-interest-rate loans, encouraging people to open new businesses and recommending 1 percent interest loans to pay off high-interest rate credit card debts.
I could actually see into their glass vaults. There were endless stacks of bundled cash.
And I thought to myself, what a wonderful world There must not be a Federal Reserve!
Then I woke up for real. I thought, Why dont we have that life?
The Federal Reserve was dreamed up anyway. What if the Fed was just a bad dream? What would America look like without the Federal Reserve?
We need to wake up and demand Congress kill the 1913 law that created the monster better known as the Federal Reserve System.
All the greedy, lying, self-serving Congressmen and women are in the pockets of the nations big banks. And the big banks are only still here because the Fed bailed all their you-know-whats out in 2008. Why? Because banks set up the Fed to do just that with free money the Fed prints at will, because it can, because in case you didnt know, the Federal Reserve notes in your wallet arent government bills, theyre notes, which are obligations, issued by the Federal Reserve (go ahead, take one out and read whats on the top).
So what does that mean? It means we all owe them  or they own us.
I got carried away there; I told you this was a really powerful dream.
Wake Up to This Reality and End the Fed
If there was no Federal Reserve, America would be free again.
The Federal Reserve System came into existence by hook, by crook, and by stealth. An entire presidential election was bought so the Federal Reserve Act could be signed into law on Christmas Eve of 1913.
The Fed then took over creation of Americas money supply (which they own) and de-fanged the U.S. Treasury to the point that its now the Feds lackey  it merely prints their Reserve Notes on rolls of special paper.
All this, by the way, is completely laid out in extraordinary depth, documented by undisputed facts in G. Edward Griffins seminal book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. Get it, read it, and be afraid.
Ill say it once more: America would be free again.
Without a Federal Reserve manipulating interest rates, free markets would allocate capital and resources like theyre supposed to.
Wed be free of the command control economy the Fed directs and gets all wrong.
Big banks wouldnt be freely regulated by the privately owned, de facto fourth pillar of government they created to foster the fantasy of central bank security.
Big banks couldnt freely leverage themselves into insolvency and expect to be bailed out by the countrys supposed savior, the real-life Wolf of Wall Street.
And most of the Feds big bank-backed employees in Congress, meaning most members of Congress, who profess their mock indignation that the Fed isnt doing enough to promote full employment, while they do nothing but line their campaign coffers with the Feds trickle-down hush money, would be freed by voters who would finally see them for what they are: Crony capitalists in Uncle Sam costumes.
And that was my dream  an America without the Federal Reserve System. It was wonderful, wasnt it? Now to make this come true

Facebook went down around 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time Thursday, causing an expected collective freakout on other social media sites like Twitter.
Websites that track status, like CurrentlyDown.com, confirmed that Facebook.com was officially down with a 503 error, and the outage lasted between 10-15 minutes before service returned.

Statistics from CurrentlyDown.com suggested that the issues were primarily experienced in the U.S. and in the U.K. but other countries such as India were showing issues as well.

Facebook did not immediately respond to TheBlazes request for comment on this outage.
The last outage the site experienced was back in July for 21 minutes, CurrentlyDown.com reported, but Venture Beat noted another outage experienced just earlier this week.


Michael Sam, who became the first openly gay player drafted by an NFL franchise, said he probably would have beenon a teams roster had he notcome out.

Sam made the observation during sportscaster Dan Patricks radio show Friday.
He told Patrick he announced he was gay a little too early for my taste in early 2014 but certain things happened that influenced him to come out  notably reporters who knew he was gay and might break the story.
I wanted to be the one to tell my own story, Sam told Patrick. I didnt want someone telling it for me.
Patrick then asked the former SEC Defensive Player of the Year if he hadnt come out, would he be on an NFL roster right now.
It probably would have been better for me if I didnt come out  I would be on a roster, Sam said, who added that he wanted to come out after making a squad.
Sam was drafted by the St. Louis Rams but was cut during training camp. He then went to the Dallas Cowboys practice squad but was released. Sam played in theCanadian Football League for a short while before he headed back to the University of Missouri where hes pursuing a masters degree.
Despite his NFL setbacks, Sam told Patrick he still wants to play in the league and believes hes a still a damn good football player.


BERNE, Switzerland (AP)  Statement provided by the Swiss Attorney General on the opening of criminal proceedings against FIFA President Sepp Blatter:
The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland (OAG) has opened criminal proceedings against the President of Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) on suspicion of criminal mismanagement as well as  alternatively  on suspicion of misappropriation.

Swiss criminal proceedings against the President of FIFA, Mr. Joseph Blatter, have been opened on 24 September 2015 on suspicion of criminal mismanagement (Article 158 Swiss Criminal Code / SCC) and  alternatively  misappropriation (Article 138 Swiss Criminal Code / SCC).
On the one hand, the OAG suspects that on 12 September 2005 Mr. Joseph Blatter has signed a contract with the Caribbean Football Union (with Jack Warner as the President at this time); this contract was unfavorable for FIFA. On the other hand, there is a suspicion that, in the implementation of this agreement, Joseph Blatter also violated his fiduciary duties and acted against the interest of FIFA and/or FIFA Marketing & TV AG.
Additionally, Mr. Joseph Blatter is suspected of a disloyal payment of CHF (Swiss francs) 2 Million to Michel Platini, President of Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), at the expense of FIFA, which was allegedly made for work performed between January 1999 and June 2002; this payment was executed in February 2011.
On 25 September 2015, representatives of the OAG interrogated the defendant Joseph Blatter following a meeting of the FIFA Executive Committee. At the same time, Michel Platini was heard as a person asked to provide information (Article 178 of the Swiss Code of Criminal Procedure).
Furthermore, the OAG conducted on 25 September 2015 a house search at FIFA Headquarters with the support of the Federal Criminal Police. The office of the FIFA President has been searched and data seized.
As for all defendants, the presumption of innocence applies for Mr. Joseph Blatter.


Bill Clinton photographed by Alexei Hay on Haiti's Central Plateau.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowI am standing under the scorching late February sun in an open field in Haiti's Central Plateau, waiting for the helicopter bearing former president Bill Clinton to arrive and getting a lesson in limes. More precisely, in what The Clinton Foundation, the philanthropic organization of global ambition founded by Clinton in 2001, is doing about limes. It's complicated.Introduced in the 15th century to Hispaniola (the name Columbus gave the island that now comprises Haiti and the Dominican Republic when he shipwrecked here in December 1492), limes were successfully cultivated in Haiti until the 1990s. "Their oil, used in cosmetics and the beverage industry, was, like Haitian vetiver, considered the best in the world," says Hugh Locke, a blan from Westchester (one is acutely aware of skin color in Haiti). Locke heads the Haitian nonprofit Smallholder Farmers Alliance (SFA) and is scanning the sky, as am I, for Clinton's craft.
More From
Town & Country MagazineDuring the 1991'94 embargo of Haiti, organized in response to the military coup that ousted the popularly elected but controversial president Jean-Bertrand Aristide (ironically, Clinton was president then), "farmers couldn't export to the U.S., and lime oil lost its value, so they cut down all their lime trees" to make sellable charcoal. "That is why the Haiti Lime Project," Locke continues, "which is intended to reintroduce several million lime trees to Haiti, is so important."Individual farmersSFA is helping them organize into for-profit cooperativesstand to increase their revenues by $750 annually (a princely sum in profoundly impoverished Haiti, where the minimum daily wage is between 150 and 300 gourdes, or $4 to $8). Furthermore, the presence of the lime trees will counteract deforestation and soil erosion, the country's huge environmental problem; you can see denuded, eroded slopes throughout its gorgeous mountain ranges, the long-term consequences of a soaring population forced, through decades of governmental neglect and corruption, to eke out a living in ecologically disastrous ways.All around us are neat rows of black plastic pots, thousands of them, with tiny lime tree seedlings poking out of the dark soil. The calm focus of the Haitian farm workers carefully watering them makes me think of nurses in a hospital intensive care unit (or a preemie ward). Which is what the Haiti Lime Project in effect is: one of a multitude of lifelines the Clinton Foundation is financing and/or securing financing and partners for in a multiprong effort to help this country, the poorest in the Western Hemisphere, stand on its own feet. The partners in this particular endeavor are: Firmenich the Swiss oils and essences company, which will buy the limes the farmers grow at market rates; Acceso which works with Haitian lime producers as well as peanut growers (peanut plants will be "intercropped" with lime trees as another source of revenue and to aid in the renourishing of the soil); and SFA, which will distribute the seedlings and offer technical support to farmers as needed."Clinton was the broker," Locke says. "He brought us together." It is the Clinton Foundation way: to build and fast-track creative collaborations between businesses, NGOs, governments, and individuals to address urgent needs in communities at risk. The foundation, the most powerful imagining ever of what a post-presidency can be, currently employs 2,200 people across its various initiatives (including the Clinton Global Initiative), and according to its statistics, CGI members have made 3,100 Commitments to Action in 180 countries, affecting the lives of 430 million people. (In Haiti alone there are currently 30 foundation-supported investments, and 208 Clinton Global Initiative commitments.) And Clinton, now 68 years old and 14 years into his next act, is as fired up about his work as any man could be. "It has been my whole life for longer than I was president," he tells me later. "And we have a huge plate of business to do this year."As Clinton's chopper touches down, his shock of white hair is immediately recognizable, like a beacon, amid his entourage. (The group includes Sean Penn, who has his own Clinton Foundation supported project in Port-au-Prince's Delmas 32 neighborhood: the J/P HRO's Community Center and Urban Garden, which we'll visit tomorrow. "Thank you for our very existence in Haiti," Penn will say with emotion to Clinton.) A slow, ritualistic procession ensues, up and down the rows of seedlings. The point seems to be equal parts inspection and conversation, with farmers, community organizersanyone who is affiliated with the enterprise, who was allowed onto the site, and who has succeeded in getting Clinton's attention. He is generous with it, engaged and in the moment despite the midday sun, which is turning his pale skin pink. He asks questions, listens, nods, touches arms and shouldersbonding gestures that quickly put his interlocutors at ease in the charmed circle of his celebrity. He is exemplary in his attention to detail, respectful in his curiosity.
Bill Clinton inspecting the Cholera Treatment Center with Sean Penn.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowFor all its intimate down-homeness, the visit is carefully orchestrated to project Clinton's message onto a larger stagein this case the importance to Haiti of small-scale farming and reforestation. The Haitian media have been invited, and they follow Clinton's progress, recording his words and gestures. This flat bit of farmland two hours along bad roads from Port-au-Prince is his pulpit to the Haitian people and to their government and, by extension, its controversial president, former pop star Michel Martelly. His perambulation communicates that this is how it can be done, this works, this will help. A little Haitian girl, hair braided, dressed in what is surely her Sunday best, walks solemnly beside him, too young to understand or care who this big blan is but happily holding his hand. That visual too is a messagewe must do this for your childrenand a reminder that nothing of lasting value can be achieved without a robust and universal system of education and the empowerment of girls, two other pillars of the Clinton Foundation's work. As Denis O'Brien, the billionaire chairman of Digicel (a telecommunications giant with an extensive footprint in Central America, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean), tells me without a trace of irony, "The president is the chief development officer in Haiti."
It has been almost an hour since touchdown, and a little throng has encircled Clinton and is not letting him go.His advance team is starting to sweat, and not just from the heat. There goes the schedule. We have one more site visit today, a foundation-supported agricultural production facility that supplies castor oil for the Kreyol Essence line of Haitian-produced "eco-luxury" beauty products. (I will witness Bill Clinton, reading glasses on, approvingly scrutinizing the fine print on a jar of made-in-Haiti hair pomade.) And then more events the next day in Port-au-Prince, including the brand new Cholera Treatment Center, a revelatory, architecturally striking model for what a health clinic in the developing world should be, andthe piece de resistancethe official opening of the gleaming new eight-story, $48 million Marriott, the first internationally branded and managed hotel in Haiti, financed and owned by Digicel, a deal brokered by Clinton and the reason we are all in Haiti at this particular moment."Town & Country!" a Clinton aid shouts in my direction after his boss stops for a brief photo op. "Run! We're going to try and beat the president's helicopter!"There are countries in the world with crystal clear stories that elevate the spirit and make the heart beat faster: ancient Egypt, with its miraculous monuments and first deeply articulated concept of eternity; classical Greece, the first democracy and creator of humanistic philosophy; America, the still unrivaled land of individual opportunity. And Haiti.In 1791, in the French Caribbean colony then called Saint-Domingue, black slaves rose up in rebellion, led by four outstanding military leaders, three of whom were former slaves themselves: Toussaint Louverture, Henri Christophe, and Jean-Jacques Dessa-lines (Alexandre Petion, a free mulatto, was the fourth). After 13 years of brutal fighting they defeated France, Britain, and Spain at the peak of their powers; the last expeditionary force of 22,000 French troops was commanded by none other than Napoleon's brother-in-law, General Charles Leclerc. The rebels' victory abolished within Saint-Domingue's bordersand for the first time anywhereone of the world's great outrages: the murderous exploitation of African slaves. (The French plantation system in Saint-Domingue was especially lucrative and gruesome.) In 1804 the world's first independent black republic was established. As national creation narratives go, it's pretty unbeatable.But then things largely fell apart. The revolutionary leaders were either killed or died early. (Louverture, the father of the rebellion, perished in a French prison in the Jura Mountains.) The leadership vacuum was exacerbated by a 57-year embargo of the new nation by the colonial powers, including the United States (which did not recognize Haiti until 1862, under Lincoln). Thomas Jefferson had called Louverture's troops "cannibals." The British were likewise not amused; they worried the revolution might spread to Jamaica and its plantation economy, just 119 miles away. Haiti was an inconvenient country."The embargo lasted longer than the Cuban embargo, a very long time for a people just out of slavery," said Max Beauvoir, a former chemical engineer educated in New York and Paris, and a Vodou priest (now the religion's "pope," as he is known), whom I met at his home and temple. "But they survived. It is what is called the resilience of the Haitian people."Many of Haiti's subsequent problems, to be sure, were not foreign-caused. There were dictatorships and disasters and demented policies, like the late-19th-century governmental get-rich scheme that imposed a heavy export tax on coffee and succeeded in limiting the profits of one of the world's largest coffee industries. (Many of the lovely but decrepit mansions you can see today in Cap-Haitien, on the north coastonce one of the richest and most important French cities in the Americaswere built by 19th-century coffee exporters.) Bringing back soil-nourishing Haitian coffee production is another Clinton Foundation project (through the La Colombe Coffee Roasters brand).Tourism, the economic lifeblood of many a Caribbean nation, became in Haiti, for most of the last century, an elite thing, and therefore not particularly revenue-generating. "We were for so long, and still are, in a bubble of negativity," says Jean-Cyril Pressoir, who optimistically founded Tour Haiti in 2005 and who organized my trip. Foreigners who did come were those interested in seeing past the surface shabbiness to the cultural sophistication beneathartistic, musical, and spiritualwhat Maryse Penette-Kedar, co-founder of Prodev, one of Haiti's largest and most respected NGOs, matter-of-factly calls "a national noblesse, the finesse of people who have no access to anything."The visitorswriters and artists and musicians, anthropologists and journalists, development workers and diplomatsgenerally converged at the bar and on the porch of Port-au-Prince's Oloffson Hotel. Immortalized in Graham Greene's The Comedians as the Trianon, it still stands amid dense tropical vegetation in all its run-down splendor, Vodou-inspired objets scattered about the grounds. "We have a lot of repeats," says its Princeton-educated owner, Richard Morse. "People either want this a lot, or not." Sort of like Haiti.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowThe hope is that the new Marriott will help counteract some of the reticence. "I want visitors to see Haiti through you, through this hotel," Clinton told the staff during the opening ceremony on the Marriott's vast terrace cum lounge cum palm treestudded pool area. "If everyone could see this country the way Denis [O'Brien] and I do, you would have many times more visitors flooding in and your incomes would be three times what they are, and we wouldn't have the troubles that we do."As with any other Clinton Foundationsupported project, the Marriott is not just a hotel but an economic engine meant to move Haiti toward a brighter future. As part of its commitment to the foundation, it procures products locally and employs some 200 Haitians, many of them purposefully culled from Port-au-Prince's marginalized and thought to be unemployable, according to general manager Peter Antinoph. (The staff members are lovely and eager, some still charmingly in training, and they have clearly won the lottery.) The hope, O'Brien tells me in summary, is that the hotel will not just attract tourism but make other foreign investors comfortable and also create a pipeline of Haitian managers who "15 or 20 years from now will open their own places. It's about exposing the talent here." O'Brien pauses. "If you make money in the developing world, you can sleep at night only if you also make a social impact. We do not want to be seen as modern-day conquistadors."

Town & Country Magazine"I was always interested in Haiti," Clinton tells me during a long and wide-ranging interview in his Harlem office after our return. It was the creation story, "but what really got me fired up was a trip we took in December 1975, after Hillary and I got married. We stayed in Port-au-Prince, in one of those wonderful gingerbread houses, a hotel run by a Viennese couple. Those old houses should be restored! It was near the Oloffson, but we didn't have money for that."Clinton bought his first piece of Haitian art then. "Haitians are unusually gifted," he says. "My home today is full of Haitian paintings and metalwork." The Clintons toured the cathedral on that first trip. They watched on Independence Day as the infamous president Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier laid a wreath on the central Champs de Mars at the statue of the Unknown Slave, who is shown blowing a conch shell to summon his brethren to revolution. "I noted the incongruity of that," Clinton says, shaking his head, "because I was standing next to one of the dreaded Tontons Macoutes wearing those dark glasses."And he learned about Vodou. "I didn't buy all those American zombie movies," he says, clearly fascinated by the topic and by the different expressions the near-universal human belief in a nonphysical spirit force can take. "Hillary and I wanted to understand." That's when the Clintons met Max Beauvoir ("God, he was handsome!" Clinton exclaims), who spent all day explaining Vodou theology to the Clintons and its distant roots in the religion of the Fon people of what is now Benin. The young couple attended a nighttime ceremony. Vodou's central ritual is a dance during which spirits possess believers."I saw some unbelievable things that night. I'll never forget it. And I'm very grateful for that," Clinton says. (So much so that the Beauvoir meeting gets a section in Clinton's 2004 autobiography, My Life.)Beauvoir explained something else to Clinton: the social role of the Vodou priest in this culture. "And I'll never forget this, either," Clinton tells me. Beauvoir said to him, "We practice this because it is our faith. But also because there is no government outside of Port-au-Prince; there is no social structure. There is nothing. We have to feed them, we have to give them medicine. We have to take care of the people here."Since then Clinton has traveled to Haiti 38 times; he was only the second sitting American president to go there (in 1995). In 2009 he was appointed by Ban Ki-moon UN Special Envoy to Haiti after a series of hurricanes had decimated the country's GDP by 15 or 20 percent. A year later, after the earthquake knocked the economy down by two-thirds, he became co-chair, with Haitian prime ministers Jean-Max Bellerive and Garry Conille, of the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission. "President [George W.] Bush and I raised about $50 million to promote business development in Haiti. Then I raised another $30 million to promote smaller enterprises that help people at the bottom of the pyramid, educational and healthcare projects. And then there are the commitments made to the Clinton Global Initiative, which within four years will have gotten around $500 million of investment through."Clinton is proud of that yet unhappy about the country's continuing lack of a national plan. Although it now has one of the fastest-growing economies in the Caribbean, Haiti, he says, "never had a strategyfor social, economic, and educational development, including healthcare. What happens if you don't have systems, predictable rewards for responsible behavior, is that everything becomes a one-off." The Interim Reconstruction Commission was the attempt to create priorities and accountability. Acknowledging that the commission was "incredibly cumbersome," Clinton is nonetheless clearly frustrated that in 2011 it was dismantled by President Martelly. Some of the reasons, Clinton says, "were good, and some probably not so good." Indeed. Martelly, who is four years into a five-year term, is being widely criticized for weakening state institutions, for consolidating power by failing to hold scheduled elections, for corruption, and for being out of touch with Haiti's poorperhaps another Haitian strongman in the making."But let me tell you a story," Clinton says. I settle in. His stories are long. "Along the road from the Port-au-Prince airport to downtown, there used to be a long metal fence where Haitian street artists hung their paintings for sale. The second time I went back to Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake, just a couple of weeks after, eight of themeight hardy soulswere back. I was with the UN then, so I had a big old crowd with me, and I said, 'Stop! Everybody get out and everybody buy something. And no bargaining this time. Whatever they ask for, we'll pay. If you don't have any money, I'll pay for it.' I got out and bought a couple of little paintings, and then saw a guy around the corner. 'President Clinton,' he said, 'You bought a painting from me several years ago. I have another.' So I went over, bought the painting, and started talking to the guy. I said, 'I really respect you guys for coming out here so soon.' He said, 'You shouldn't. I have nothing else to do. My wife and children were all killed.' And I said, 'Why are you here?' And he said, 'Because I loved them very much, and this is my way of honoring them. Because we artists, we're family, and they know that if I can be here, they have no excuse not to be. We have to begin again.'Advertisement - Continue Reading Below"It's very important to understand that that is Haiti too," Clinton continues, clearly moved. "You see all the messed-up politics, and all the lack of capacity. And then something like that. That is why you have all these people who fall hopelessly in love with the place and never want to give up on it and are prepared to live with the frustrations. And also to be criticized because we can't work miracles." (Note the "we.") "Because there's no place quite like it on planet Earth."Clinton is aware that the world at this very moment may be slightly more interested in the political plans of his wife than in his foundation, and he is willing to play a game of If She Does Run. (At press time Hillary Clinton had not announced her decision.) "I think it's important, and Hillary does too, that she go out there as if she's never run for anything before and establish her connection with the voters," he says. "And that my role should primarily be as a backstage adviser to her until we get much, much closer to the election. So our plan is to spend this whole year working on the foundation, which is, by a good long stretch, the most transparent of all the presidential foundations and more transparent than a lot of other major foundations in the country. It should be, both because I believe in it and because Hillary is in public life, and we'll get criticized, as some people are criticizing me, for taking money from a foreign government. We did a review of the whole foundation last year." Clinton is emphatic about this and intent on my noting it. "We got suggestions from a great law firm that also does pro bono counsel for Doctors Without Borders, and we implemented every single one of them."
And if Hillary does become president? "First, I would have to assess what she wants me to do," he says. "And second, we might have to change the [foundation] rules again. But we haven't talked about that yet, and I don't think we should. You can't. It's hard for any party to hang on to the White House for 12 years, and it's a long road. A thousand things could happen."Whatever occurs, Clinton's priority is to keep the foundation alive, "whether I'm running it or not. I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody. I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my grand daughter last night, and I can't be mad."Perhaps not mad, but still passionate about the problems that concern him. Like Haiti's. "They have to keep welcoming investors. We have to improve the road network. Reforestation has to succeed!" As I'm leaving his officeor, at least, trying to leavethe president doesn't want to let it go. "Did you see the Citadelle, near Cap- Haitien?" He is referring to the largest and best preserved of a network of some 25 mountaintop fortresses conceived by Henri Christophe in the event of a French return to Haiti. It is shaped like the prow of a giant ship. I had. "It's the most impressive architectural achievement in the Caribbean," he enthuses. "It is breathtaking! And the idea that it was built in the early 1800s, designed by someone who not only did not have a degree in architecture but had no university degreethey imagined it and they built it!" A Clintonian accolade if ever there was one. And not unlike a foundation built by a former president.The keys to visiting Haiti are a well- organized itinerary, a car and driver, and a guide.

While many Americans face working longer and delaying retirement, it might seem an intuitive next step to assume that chronic disease could become more prevalent in the workplace.
But researchers in a new study published in the journal Preventing Chronic Disease this week found the opposite might be the case.

Employed older adults had better health outcomes than unemployed older adults. Physically demanding occupations had the lowest risk of poor health outcomes, suggesting a stronger healthy worker effect, the study authors wrote.
AsAlberto Caban-Martinez, an epidemiologist at the University of Miami, put in in an interview with NPR, theres something about the aging process  that if you stay working, then you stay hardy.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 22 percent of the U.S. workforce will be composed of adults age 65 or older by 2022. Previous studies on the health of older workers had limitations, these study authors wrote, leading them in their study to characterize 4 major health status measures of older US workers and nonworkers using a representative sample of the US population and controlling for potential sociodemographic and health behavior confounders such as education, race/ethnicity, sex, age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, obesity, and marital status.
Data covering a 15-year timeframewas collected from the National Health Interview Survey, which is conducted in person. The sample included over 83,000 adults 65 years or older.
According to the researchers analysis, the average individual in the study was a 75-year-old nonsmoker with one to two chronic health conditions who was retired. Those who were employed were most likely to be in white-collar positions, while smaller numbers included those who were farmers or in blue-collar and service jobs.
Being unemployed/retired was associated with the greatest risk of poor health across all health status measures, even after controlling for smoking status, obesity, and other predictors of health, the researchers wrote.
Of those still working, those in blue-collar or service positions had better health outcomes than those in white-collar positions.
The study did note that it found a lower likelihood of multimorbidity among blue collar men but not blue collar women, which might indicate the differences in the types of blue collar jobs in which older adults of different sexes engage The study also suggested that those of lower socioeconomic status could have strong health benefits from longer employment due to increasing social support and income and by providing access to more comprehensive health insurance coverage.
NPR pointed out that the study authors are unsure though if continued work causes good health or if good health means someone is more likely to keep working.
Its kind of the chicken or egg problem, Caban-Martinez said. Maybe poor physical health is not allowing people to be in the workforce.


Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton, a life-long Methodist, attended abicentennial celebration at her former church in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, where a retired pastor gave her some pointed advice: be nicer to the media.
Pastor J. Philip Wogaman, the former pastor of Foundry United Methodist Church  where theClintons worshipped during Bill Clintons presidency  based his advice for Clinton on Romans 12, the Associated Press reported.

I got some advice from Dr. Wogaman just earlier this morning, which I promise I will put into effect, Clinton said while speaking at the event. Basically he said, if youre going to read and listen to Romans 12 you got to be nicer to the press.
She continued,So, to my friends in the press, I will certainly take that to heart.
Clintons response sparked laughter from the audience, as it is no secret that there has been tension at times between her campaign and various members of the media.
Romans 12:17-18 reads, Do not repay anyone evil for evil.Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.

The former first lady avoided getting political during her address and, instead, shared the importance of her Methodist faith as well as her gratitude for theFoundry United Methodist Church, which she said was a refuge of sorts during her husbands presidency.
Here we were not the first family, we were just our family, she said. And we relished and cherished that time.

A Saudi prince was arrested Wednesday on sexual assault charges at a Southern California mansion.
The Los Angeles Police Department said 28-year-old Majed Abdulaziz Al-Saud, a member of the royal family of Saudi Arabia, tried to force a woman into performing sex acts with him inside a rented $37 million mansion in Beverly Hills. The home is surrounded by an 8-foot wall as part of a gated community, KNBC-TV reported.
Neighbors said they saw a woman bleeding and trying to climb the wall to escape. Residents then led officers to the property around 1:30 p.m. and Al-Saud was arrested.

While some heads of state and members of their families have diplomatic immunity, the LAPD said Al-Saud does not because of his dignitary status in Saudi Arabia and the level of his alleged crime.
The Saudi prince was freed on $300,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 19, where he will face a charge of forced oral copulation, according to the Los Angeles Times. He also faces charges of battery andfalse imprisonment, NBC News reported.
Police said other foreign nationals have stayed at the $37 million mansion in the past several weeks but that up until Wednesday, the biggest incidents neighbors complained of were a couple of noisy parties.

It was not clear the exact relationship Al-Saud has to King Salman of Saudi of Arabia, but NBC News noted that the royal family is made up of as many as 10,000 people, including Salmans extended kin.
Salman was crowned king in January following the death of King Abdullah.

After a Kansas police officer and his fiancee picked up their to-go order from a Taco Bell in Newton on Saturday night, the couple experienced quite a shock.
The word PIG was penned in what appears to be black marker on at least two of their items:
Image source: KAKE-TV
The couple told KAKE-TVthey called and spoke to the manager on duty, who said they could bring back the five soft tacos and get new ones. When the couple told the manager they couldnt return since they were both working, she saidshe would arrange to get their money refunded and food remade.
But on Sunday Taco Bell told KAKE theyve done one better and fired the employee who left the nasty notes.
We do not share the same belief or view as the employee whatsoever,Jeff Graves, senior director of operations for Taco Bell, told the station. Our company, Taco Bell, has always been pro-law enforcement, military. Weve always supported the police in our community. Many of our restaurants give police discounts when they come in and eat.
Graves added that hes been in touch with the couple.
Weve of course apologized to him, all the Newton Police officers and, in fact, everyone in the community, he added to KAKE. In fact, Ive even met with the lieutenant with the Newton Police Department this morning, and were even going to plan a community event working with the Newton Police officers within the next week just to show our support for the officers and the community.



Shanghai Book Traders, a Chinese book import agency, told the APon Mondaythat as expected it was suspending plans to import former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons Hard Choices.
An employee of the company  which would have been the key importer of the English-language version of the book  who identified himself as Hua, stated that the agency canceled their order of Ms. Clintons newest memoir after discovering some of the books content  but did not identify what in particular the company deemed problematic.

The New York Times notes that among other China-related sections of the book, Clinton devotes an entire chapter to the drama of how she personally intervened to help a blind dissident, Chen Guangcheng, seek refuge in the United States Embassy in Beijing in 2012, and then negotiated over several days with furious Chinese officials to allow him to go to the United States.
According to the Times:

The Chinese government would interpret Mrs. Clintons personal involvement in the Chen case as an effort by the American secretary of state to overturn the regime, an editor at a Chinese publishing house said in an interview Friday. The editor declined to be named for fear of reprisals.
Chen Guangcheng is sensitive by himself, the editor said. But if Hillary supported him, thats like her going up against the Chinese government.
The Chinese government would not under any circumstances allow the book to appear with that narrative, the editor said.

Buzzfeed notes thatClintons bookis critical of the Chinese government. She details its censorship practices and characterizes the country as full of contradictions and the epicenter of the antidemocratic movement in Asia.
The titles publisher, Simon & Schuster

said last week that it regretted that no Chinese publishers had been allowed to translate and distribute the book and said it was also disappointed that the English-language version wasnt available in the mainland.
As Secretary Clinton writes in the book, some of the hardest choices facing China today regard protecting human rights and free expression, the president of the publisher, Jonathan Karp, said in a statement.

Karp also told Buzzfeed that Chinas response to Clintons book represented an effective ban by the country. Further:
Its outrageous and unfortunate, Karp said. And its a pretty clear indication of the low level of intellectual freedom in China right now.


Donald  Donnie  Grooms lost his job in St. Louis in a layoff on April 30.
After nearly five months of looking and exhausting every possible avenue he could think of, on Wednesday he put on a blue button-down and red tie, printed off 800 resumes and stood on the side of the road outside of Busch Stadium, home of the St. Louis Cardinals.

Unorthodox? Definitely. But he was hoping it might get him a business card or two, a lead  something.
Donnie Grooms stood outside Busch Stadium with a stack of resumes. He didnt think his stunt to pass them out went well, but then he learned his picture was going viral. This picture, Grooms said, was snapped on his phone by a local tour guide named Matthew Fanning. (Photo courtesy Donnie Grooms)
At the end of the day, he only handed out about 40 resumes. Disappointed and feeling defeated, he told TheBlaze that he went home to his wife with his tail between his legs.
But she knew something he didnt.
She was like, My phone is blowing up. My Facebook is blowing up, he said.
A picture Grooms had taken of himself as he stood on the side of the road with his resumes in hand and a sign strapped to his case was starting going viral, becoming what would be known as #FindDonnieAJob.
The picture of Grooms and his sign UNEMPLOYED  My Familys Dreams Dont Work Unless I Do! Please Take a Resume!!  had over 2.5 million views within 12 hours of being posted to the social news site Reddit and to Instagram. His LinkedIn profile has been visited more than 500 times and he says he received several possible leads that he still has to evaluate the legitimacy of. Possible opportunities have come in front around the country and the world, but hes really hoping to stay in the St. Louis area.
So what field is Grooms looking in?
He describes himself as a jack of all trades who is over-educated in some respects. Though he has a doctorate in chiropractics, he said hes not looking to be directly in the field. Hed like to teach or do research thats related, but in the end, he said, hes looking for a job that will support my family.
Overall, Grooms said the job-seeking experience has been eye-opening to him, adding that since the last time he was on the market things have changed in how people apply for jobs and how resumes are evaluated.
Hes applied to positions online, refined his LinkedIn profile, made the connections he can and has been left trying to think outside the box.
Grooms said is overwhelmed and he never expected his picture to go viral and now hopes that it helps him locate a position that will allow him to support his family.


WASHINGTON (TheBlaze/AP)  An emotional House Speaker John Boehner says he woke up Friday morning and decided to announce his resignation from Congress because prolonged turmoil over his leadership would do irreparable harm to the House.
The Ohio Republican says he had planned to leave the speakership by the end of the year anyway. But he says he moved up his timetable as unrest among conservatives threatened the House.
He told reporters at a news conference it has been an honor to serve in the House for 25 years and as its top leader. He says California congressman Kevin McCarthy, the No. 2 House Republican, would make an excellent speaker.
Moments earlier, President Barack Obama reacted to Boehners resignation during a press conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
John Boehner is a good man, Obama said. He is a patriot. He cares deeply about the House and the institution for which he has served for a long time. He cares about his constituents and he cares about America.
Obama also said Boehner also treated him with courtesy and civility and kept his word when he made a commitment.

This has already been quite the banner week for abortion disciples.
Just a few hours ago, Democrats voted down a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks. Only three Democrats voted forthe bill to protect children from murder after five months of development, while two truly despicable Republicans, Susan Collins and Mark Kirk, voted against it. They should be out of a job when it comes time for reelection, and if I was in charge of these things, Id put them both in prison, along with almost all of the Democrats, for facilitating the murder of thousands of innocent human lives. Remember, if you support late term abortion, you are in favor of killing babies who can survive outside the womb. This is a radical, insane, extremist position, and one that is considered by progressives to be not only mainstream, but mandatory.

Progressives love to say they arent pro-abortion, but that is a more and more self-evident lie. Nobody who possesses even the slightest hint of a moral qualm with abortion could actually oppose a bill to protect kids after five months in the womb. Similarly, nobody who isnt an enormous fan of abortion could be anything but repulsed by the hip new fadthat swept through the internet like wild fire yesterday.
Its called #ShoutYourAbortion, and it encourages women to boast confidentlyof killing their children. The hashtag has been trending on Twitter for over a day, and many hundreds and thousands of women have taken the opportunity to shout with pride about the magical wonders of baby murder. Im surethe aborted babies would have loved to participate in this campaign, but theyre all dead and decomposed in dumpsters or dissected in petri dishes.
The Shout Your Abortion craze appears to have started with a post by a woman named Amelia, who took to Facebook over the weekend to brag about her own abortion experiences. She said her abortion, procured last year, fills her with an inexpressible level of gratitude, and that shes not ashamed to say abortions make her happy. This post was shared by another woman, Lindy, who used the Shout Your Abortion hashtag while tellingher own triumphant tale of filicide. She said she had an abortion a few years ago and it allowed her to be fulfilled by her career, and, bizarrely, enabled her to better care for her kids.

Along with plenty of pushing by Planned Parenthood and others in the Baby Murder Industry, this was enough to send the campaign into lift off. Progressives sensed they had a catchy, fun way to battle the taboo surrounding the butchery of infants, and soon Twitter was filled withdeeply disturbed and spiritually destitute women saying things like this:
Ive had 2 abortions. I dont have to justify or explain them to anybody. My life is more valuable than a potential life.
Yeah, so I had an abortion at 20, it was the best decision possible for us then. I will #ShoutYourAbortion with no more shame.
So heres my #ShoutYourAbortion: I was pregnant when I didnt want to be. I got to decide and I owe no one an explanation for my decision.
Had an abortion procedure done at age 22 because I was WAY too young to parent. Have never, ever regretted it.
Not becoming a parent while I was still a child was wise & merciful. I send love 2 providers & to all ppl being shamed. #shoutyourabortion
Ive never wanted to have children, so I had an abortion. Im thriving, without guilt, without shame, without apologies. #ShoutYourAbortion
#ShoutYourAbortion is so important  abortion is a normal medical procedure & one way we can help end stigma is by talking about it.
Ive had 3 abortions and have held onto shame since I was 14. I am 43 now. My shame and silence ends today.
Had an abortion because you wanted one?You need not justify, explain or hide.Your body, your choice. All day, every day.#ShoutYourAbortion
Liberal websites and blogs joined in the abortion party. Buzzfeed beamed that Shout Your Abortion is finally challenging the stigma attached to crushing the skulls of tiny humans. Elle expressed excitement that the campaign gives women a new way to talk about choice. HuffPost took the opportunity to chastise pro-lifers for shaming and belittling the brutal slaughter of infants. MIC.com called the hashtag inspiring. The Independentsaid the celebration of death and selfishnessis important and encouraging. MTVdeclared that Shout Your Abortion is setting the record straight and making it easier and more acceptable for women to destroytheir children  an act which they describe creepily and creatively as clearing a biological hurdle.
If only the Nazis had Twitter maybe they could have defeated those pesky taboos about violently eradicating Jews. #ShoutYourGenocide, anyone?
Something has a stigmawhen its marked with disgrace, and progressives clearly cannot allow abortion to be seen in that light. Politically incorrect words and ideas, Confederate flags, jokes  these can all be viciously stigmatized, but child murder? That must be greeted with nothing short of uproarious applause.Some people seem shocked that the Abortion Movement would stoop to this level, just as some are shocked that so many Democrats want to murder viable infants, but what else would you expect these people to do? If theyre going to earn converts, they need their disciples to be more than just reluctantly accepting of some abortions. They need pro-aborts to be pumped about all abortion, excited, joyful. All of that excitement and joy, when presented by post-abortive mothers, obviouslymasks a deep sense of guilt and despair, but the Abortion Industry doesnt care about whats going on deep inside these women. They care about polishing thefalse exterior.
Nobody, on either side, can really stake out a moderate position on abortion for very long. Either abortion is condemned with the fury of 1,000 suns, or it is celebrated and glorified with religious fervor. Everyone who tries to hang out somewhere between these two extremes will inevitably land on one end of the spectrum or the other. Thats because abortion is an extreme thing. It is the slaughter of the innocent. History proves that there are really, when it comes down to it, only two types of people: those radically opposed to the dehumanization and murder of entire groups of people, and those radically in favor of it.
So the abortion industry will obviously set up camp on the latter side of that equation, and do what it can to pull as many of us into that moral black hole as possible. Just a couple of years ago, abortion fetishists cooked up the viral 1 in 3 campaign, encouraging women to tell their inspiring stories about abortion. Not long after that, a woman named Emily Letts became a progressive darling when she filmed herself having an abortion. She giggled and smiled through the procedure, talking about how happy and lucky she is. When it was all done she yelled cool! and yay! as she was wheeled out of the operating room and her child was, most likely, shipped off to a research facility for experimentation. She bragged about her abortion while it was happening, and the video received favorable coverage across the mainstream media, and eventually wontop prize in an abortion stigma-busting video competition (leading some to believe it was staged). These #ShoutYourAbortion Tweets are nothing compared to all that.

Even so, its obviously enormously disturbing, infuriating, sad, and pitiful to see these deluded women and their acquiescent male allies parading around, waving an I Heart Abortion banner for all to see, but we should beglad theyre putting it out there. Notglad about the abortions or that theyre so brazen and shameless about them, but that the true nature of the pro-choice movement is on display for anyone who hasnt yet gotten a freaking clue. For all their depravity and hideousness, these Abortions Rock! marketing campaigns at least perform the valuable service of providing us with a glimpse atmodern liberalisms real face. Like its author, the Devil, progressive doctrine often comes hip and coiffed and wearing trendy hats and saying dumb, popular things like tolerance for all and love wins and heteronormativity causes the otherization of non-cisgendered communities and so on, yet at its base, in its core, lies a deep animosity towards life itself.
Liberalism is, in the end, a death cult. Ive long suggested that we stop calling it liberalism and start calling it secular Satanism, because thats trulythe most accurate and coherent way to describe it. Indeed, self-proclaimed Satanists are ardent abortion fans, with some reporting that they perform Satanic human sacrificesinside abortion clinics. To the Satanist/liberal, abortion is the most sacred and revered sacrament. The whole religion and ideology of Satanism/liberalism was born when Satan himself turned from God and said, I will not serve  and what better and more profound way for humans to reinforcethat point than to ritualistically massacre His most vulnerable and precious children?
Abortion evangelists are pro-abortion in principle, not out of some perverted sense of necessity or compassion. They believe  they have faith  that the individual is supreme. There is no power or authority above the Mighty Me, therefore nothing has the right to impose itself on Me, and nothing, not even my own child, can claim any right to my life or my body or my love or my time. My, Me, I. I am the sole point and purpose of the universe, and the highest thing I can hope to attain is my own enjoyment, convenience, and (especially sexual) pleasure. There is no Truth outside of that. There is no God beyond myself.
Every other Mighty Me can live in their own bubble of self-gratification and self-worship, and if two Mes happen to bump into one another, its best if theyre polite simply because it would make them both feel good to have a pleasant interaction. This is why the only Bible verse progressives cite (aside from dont judge, which isnt a Bible verse) is the one that says, Love your neighbor as yourself. They take this to mean self-love is the highest love, and that we ought to usuallytreatothers fair as a matter of pragmatism, because it would make us feel good to be treated fairly too. They miss the whole rest of Scripture, which explains in great detail that we must love God above everything and everybody, including ourselves, and that through our love for God we come to truly love ourselves and our neighbors. Progressivism/Satanism removes God from that equation, leaving only the self, which cuts off the source and purpose of the love, turning itinto the opposite of itself.
Thats why the other Mes dontalways have to beaffordedrespect or even basic human dignity. The moment one of them becomes a burden  the moment they ask us to change or give or serve or love in any sort of active way  is when they transform into a grossparasiteto be extractedand discarded. The ultimate example of this is abortion, and the point is driven home even harder when the babiesare killed and then cut up and used for medical research. We, the Mighty Mes, think nothing of attempting to extend our lives by cannibalizing our ownchildren. After all, I am Me, the one true God, and what greater cause could there be than prolonging my own existence?
But this goes beyond abortion, of course. The elderly and the sick ought to also be, according to progressivism, candidates for their own form of abortion. Unborn children have no right to impose themselves, but neither do the old and the infirm. Get rid of them all, says the progressive/Satanist. And dont take my old and infirm line to mean only the old and infirm should be tossed aside. Already in Europe theyve legalized euthanasia for young children. It wont be long before a child who escapes murder by abortion can simply be transitioned into a murder-by-euthanasia program. They might have to call in a different doctor, or maybe not. Im not quite sure if professionals in the Murder Industry normally specialize in only one type, or if they sometimes branch out.
In any event, it makes sense that abortion fans have finally abandoned thesafe, legal, and rare mantra. Certainly, they want it to be legal, and although women often die from having their insides cut apart during abortions, pro-aborts still like to push the ridiculous myth that sticking a poison needle into a childs heart while hes still inside his mothers womb can be safe. But rare is not a priority, and it never was. About the only people who prattle on about the fantastical rare abortion are moderate conservativeswho think child murder should be totally illegal except for the rare rape or incest situation when the kid is, I guess, just out of luck. Everyone else has establisheda more absolutist position on the subject. True pro-lifers think abortion should never be legal or condoned, and pro-choicers think it should never be limited or minimized.
Why should a woman be empowered only rarely, they ask? Why should she, the Deified Me, be permitted to exercise her autonomy in rare circumstances? If abortion is legal and acceptable because the life of the child is meaningless and the convenience of the mother is sacrosanct, why in the world should we tryto reduce the frequency by which these meaningless things are terminated and carved into pieces for the sake of protecting a More Important Persons lifestyle? If anything, it should happen more often, shouldnt it? If we accept the underlying premise of progressive/Satanic ideology, trying to limit the abortion becomes nonsensical. Abortion is the highest sacrament  the ultimate and purest form of female empowerment  trying to make it rare is like a devout Catholic saying he wishes to only rarely receive the Eucharist.
This is also why progressives/Satanists dont bother much with arguments over the personhood anymore. They might throwit out there as a standard defense, but its not that essentialto their cause. Whether the unborn entity is a person or a human or a moose or an alien from outer space, it doesnt matter. Abortion is permissible and even laudable purely because the woman wants it, period. Thats the one argument (if you can call it that) I saw repeated over and over again by the #ShoutYourAbortion crew. A few here and thereoffered some weak rationalization about how the babies are clumps of cells and yadda yadda, but most just said, Hey, I felt like having an abortion so I did. The end.
This is their new (although its not really new at all, its as ancient as time itself) defense of evil. And its actually pretty smart. After all, the scientific proofs for abortion could be and have been thoroughly debunked. The practical arguments  overpopulation, poverty, disability  are fine, but also too abstract, not to mention too identical to how the Nazis justified their mass of abortions of Jews. Sotheyve settled on something completely morally vacuous and appalling, but also utterly simple and even appealing in a primitive, savage sort of way: Abortion is good because I want to have abortions, and I should be able to have what I want.
It aint exactly Aristotle, but its convincing logic nowadays.

TheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views. The opinions expressed in this channel are solely those of each individual author.


When Zack Wyatt was laid off from his government contracting job in December 2014, he was mad  mad at himself, mad at those in his life, mad at his circumstance. But it didnt take too long before he said passion got the better of him.
At just 35-years-old years old, Wyatt is a husband, the father of five children and the founder of Carolina Farm Trust, a new nonprofit organization that aims to protect farmland, support farmers in the Carolinas and foster an ecosystem of sustainable living. As Wyatt has said, agriculture is long-term, but as North Carolina relinquished hundreds of thousands of acres to urban and suburban development over the past few years, sustainable farming seemed pretty bleak.

Carolina Farm Trust, Wyatt told TheBlaze, is different from other nonprofits in that the organization doesnt approach local farmers and say, We want to help you, but youve got to do it our way. Instead, the goal of Carolina Farm Trust is simple  the nonprofit purchases farmland and leases it back to local farmers with a lease that is perfectly tailored to the farmers vision. And from there, Wyatt said, the farmer can keep the land forever.

We are entering into relationships with people, and the leases will be kind of designed to be never ending as long as theyre farming, Wyatt told TheBlaze in an interview. We will have a relationship with someone and design the lease terms specifically for them, but sustainability clauses will be in there. As long as the property is being used in a sustainable way and and as long as the property is being farmed, its theirs. They can pass it along to their children or another farmer they like or give it to another farm.
Carolina Farm Trusts mission is almost a type of farming revolution as Wyatt said he plans to counter the fast track of urban sprawl by protecting farmland as his organization buys land before developers to lease to farmers. Wyatt said he asks himself,is it pure, is it raw, is it genuine and is it sustainable as to whether something is worth protecting or promoting.
Wyatt grew up on a farm in Loudon County, Virginia before he moved to the Carolinas. Before moving to the Charlotte, North Carolina area, Wyatt went to college at Coastal Carolina University, a small public school in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. After he was laid off almost two years ago, Wyatt said he began to think about his time spent in a farming community and realized people tend to live in this allusion of abundance.
[Carolina Farm Trust] is trying to bring food back to an identity, Wyatt said. We dont have an identity with farmers or our food because it has none. Between GMOs and all the ridiculous things we think were eating  if you get chicken from the grocery stores, its hard to say its chicken.
Food is this fundamental thing, he said. It gives people the opportunity to bring people together and solve a lot of issues.

Protecting farmland is easy, Wyatt said, and his organization is poised to do much more for farmers than just procure and lease the land. Carolina Farm Trust will also help farmers with any marketing needs, finding the funds for a better irrigation system and advice on growing infrastructure, among much more.
But just because its easy, doesnt mean its inexpensive.
And thats where the Carolina Jubilee comes in. The Carolina Jubilee, a festival owned by Carolina Farm Trust, will be held on Oct. 16 and Oct. 17 at VanHoy Farms in Harmony, North Carolina. The two day festival will feature local artists and local vendors, such as food, beer and wine.
By local, Wyatt said hes referring to product that are available and created in the Carolinas.
The Jubilee is a celebration of Carolina farming and agriculture, Wyatt said. Its focus is on bringing the regional economy back on the forefront so we can support local businesses and local banks.
Soon Wyatt said he hopes the revenue from the festival will be enough to finance all of their projects.
Wyatt said Carolina Farm Trust officially earned its approval from the Internal Revenue Service on May 26 as a 501(c)(3) and while the group wont lobby for anything political, he still hopes they will be able to enact change.
Were not an advocacy, policy or legislation group. We hope to influence people by our actions, but thats not what were focusing on at all, Wyatt explained. Were not going to be all about grants. Were not going to be an American Idol type of setup. Its going to be us getting out into the community in North and South Carolina and finding out what farmers need.
The community  the Carolinas  is exactly the market and region Wyatt said he and future executive directors will focus their attention. Instead of becoming a nationwide bureaucracy, Wyatt said he rather hopes Carolina Farm Trust can become a model that other local organizations can copy.
Carolina Farm Trust has already begun to work with local universities that have an agriculture focus in order to conduct research with the farms the group works with and improve on their farming techniques.

According to an editorial Wyatt wrote earlier in September,Carolina Farm Trust hopes to purchase approximately 40 acres of farmland in Lincolnton, North Carolina for Big Oak Farm. The nonprofit has until the end of the year to purchase the land from the buyer.
Farm to Table restaurants are popping up everywhere, farmers markets are growing, establishments like Earls Grocery in [Charlotte, North Carolina] are opening up, Wyatt wrote. The market is telling us that we care where are food comes from. We need to keep the momentum going and thats what we intend to do with Carolina Farm Trust.
We stand shoulder to shoulder with our Carolina Farmers and get them what they need to succeed, Wyatt said.

During a brief segment Tuesday night noting the beginning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Chicago news station WGN-TV used an image of a yellow Jewish star with the word Jude in the middle  the badge the Nazis forced Jews to wear during the Holocaust.
Holy crap, @WGNNews, this is your stock photo for a Jewish holiday?? Nobody thought that's a bad choice of photo? pic.twitter.com/z7BNuvGybS

According to the Holocaust Memorial Center, The German governments policy of forcing Jews to wear identifying badges was but one of many psychological tactics aimed at isolating and dehumanizing the Jews of Europe, directly marking them as being different (i.e., inferior) to everyone else. It allowed for the easier facilitation of their separation from society and subsequent ghettoization, which ultimately led to the deportation and murder of 6 million Jews. Those who failed or refused to wear the badge risked severe punishment, including death.

About a half hour after the tweet from Marc Karlinsky, interim editor at the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin and Chicago Lawyer magazine, WGN wrote him back and apologized:
@MarcKarlinsky We are truly sorry for inadvertently using an offensive image in our story. We apologize and deeply regret the error.
 WGN TV News (@WGNNews) September 23, 2015

The station added the same apology to Facebook.
Karlinsky noted the apology was quick and cautioned journalists far and wide:
To @WGNNews' credit, the on-air apology was quick. Let this be a good lesson to all us editors/producers who pick photos on tight deadlines.


Progressivism is an ideology built entirely on narratives.
Rarely do the narratives coincide with reality, and wherever the two contradict, the narrative wins. Every time. If progressives decided to construct a narrative that the moon is made of rock candy, it would be immediately required that every discussion about the moon be centered on reaffirming this fiction. If an astronaut visited the moon then came home and reported that, in fact, the moon does not consist of delicious sugary confections, he would be labeled a moonophobe or a moonist, and calls would ring out for his termination and possible execution. Once the narrative is established, everything surrounding it must serve the sole purpose of reinforcing it. Nothing else matters to progressives. Only the narrative.

I think if more people understood the progressive focus on narrative, and learned to be suspicious of stories that so strangely and simplistically fit right into them, we would be living in a much more rational country. We wouldnt have, for example, a Black Lives Matter movement born in athoroughly discreditedliemade up on the spot by a criminal thug. Without that movement, its likely that Ferguson and Baltimore never would have been torched, and the cops whove since been killed by the BLM race pimpswould still be alive. False narratives arent just annoying; theyre dangerous. They whip people into frenzies based on assumptions and distortions, renderingit almost impossible to calm the foamingmob once the falsehoods have taken root.
Speaking of frenzies, youve no doubt heard about Ahmed Mohemed. PoorAhmed, a high school student in Texas, became the latest cause du jour after he got in trouble for bringing a clock to school. It was a crude homemade contraptionconstructed out of wires and circuitry in a small briefcase-like box with a digital display on the front. He showed it to his engineering teacher who told him not to show it to anyone else because someone might see a box full of wires and get the wrong idea. Schools tend to be sensitive about things that look like they could explode.
Irving PD

People have since had a lot of fun pretending that Ahmeds invention (he didnt actually invent the clock, contrary to reports)was just like any old analog deviceyoud find hanging in someones kitchen. This isnt true. In fact, it did look similar to the trigger for a bomb, and if you tried to bring that thing into any other government building, you wouldnt make it through the entrance.
Eventually, hisclock came to the attention of another teacher  maybe accidentally, or maybe because Ahmed was trying to cause trouble  and that teacher reported it to the school resource officer. Ahmed was interrogated (they took him to a room in the school and asked him some questions) about the device by several cops, and thencuffed. Later, he was released without charges. If Ahmed were named Anthony or Andy or Arthur or Alex or even Anna, that would be the end of this story, and none of us ever would have heard about it. But because Ahmed is a brown-skinned Muslim with a Muslim-sounding name, progressives detected a racial angle to exploit.
Hours later,this minor and irrelevant local incident at some public school in Irving became a national sensation. Muslim activists seized on the story. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (the ones who pull Al Sharpton duties for aggrieved Muslims) wasted no time in declaring definitively that none of this would have happened if he were white. Liberals across the nation joined in, shouting about Islamophobia and right wing bigotry and yadda yadda.Social media was on fire with outrage and cries of anti-Muslim racism. The Earth shattering news was reported on every news channel. Within a day, he was giving exclusiveinterviews with MSNBC. He was a topic in the Republican debate, sandwiched in between lesser matterslike the Iran Nuclear deal and the economy. Major newspapers were publishing editorials from alleged adults claiming its nowunsafe for minority children to try to be like Steve Jobs (these hand wringers evidently dont realize that the engineering field is lousy with minorities and very few of them have ever been arrested for building electronic devices).

The President  who still hasnt had time to watch the Planned Parenthood videos that are currentlythe focusof a congressional investigation  spoke out on the travesty and invited Ahmed to be an honored guest at the White House. Naturally, Hillary Clinton got in on the action. Meanwhile, a mentally unstablecongressmanstartedparading around Capitol Hill with hisalarm clock to show solidarity.Prayer vigils were conducted for Ahmed and his clock.
Prayer vigils.
Soon, Ahmed and his father, a well known Muslim activist and former Sudanese politician, were holding press conferences, and not hesitating for even a moment to link the incident to Islamophobia and racism. Astrophysicists invitedhim to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The U.S. Space and Rocket Center announced they were designing a scholarship for him.Twitter offered him an internship. Facebook and Googleasked him to come by their respective headquarters after he finishes at the White House, MIT, Space Camp, and Twitter. The Nobel Committee awarded him the Peace Prize and the Prize in Physics. A group of progressives in California exalted him as a deity and began sacrificing their first born to him. Space aliens from a galaxy 100 trillion miles away abducted him to learn histechnological secrets.
Itsall justabsolute madness. Christians in Muslims countries are routinelystabbed, beheaded, shot, drowned, beaten, tortured, orcooked alive, and not a single one of those incidents has ever engendered this kind of response. Muslims slaughter Christians en masse and there is silence, but one Muslim kid gets asked a few questions about a clock and we all have to spend the next 96 hours of our lives seeking atonement for the sins of White America.
The kids activist father cried to the cameras that his son was put through hell, and that he washurt and was tortured and arrested and mistreated. Tortured. TORTURED. He sat in an air conditioned room for an hour. Get a grip, pops. Torture is what Muslims are doing to people overseas. What happened to Ahmed was more of an annoyance. A profitable annoyance, it turns out. Indeed, the very fact that his dad is going so absurdly and eagerly and automatically overboard makes me suspect all the more that the whole thing was a set up. At this point at least, a set up is far more likely than the idea that the kid was targeted purely for his skin color and religion.
But most will assume the latter because in our culture the narrative is what matters, and this isa perfect opportunity to reinforce the fantasy that the United States is some sort of bastion of Islamophobic hatred. Not many chances arise on that front  America is enormously tolerant of the Muslim faith  so of course they took advantage of this to the utmost.
There are many facets to any campaign to sell a liberal narrative, but these days, probably the most important are the internet memes. On social media, Ive seen a few particular memes repeated over and over again, like this one:
"They never thought he had a bomb." #iStandWithAhmed


If they thought it was a bomb, why didnt they evacuate the school???!??!?!$!??! Well, because that wasnt the issue. The cops knew it wasnt a real explosive, but they were trying to discern whether Ahmedwas attemptingto cause alarm or play some sort of joke. That would be a serious and illegal offense, and its not outside of the realm of possibility for a kid to do that sort of thing. When I went to school, we had bomb threats every once in a while, usually called in by some idiot who thought itd be funny.
The cops say Ahmed was not forthright with them and thats why this thing went on for as long as it did. They say he was being passive aggressive and refusing to answer their questions about why he brought the device to school. Ahmed retorts that all the adults are Muslim hating liars and he is pure and innocent. Choose to believe whoever you want, but either way, the fact that they didnt evacuate means nothing. Thats not the point. But the point doesnt matter in Narrative Land.
My other favorite slogan/meme is this:
Ahmed a 14yo builds a clock ,He's terrorist and gets arrested. Dylan Roof killed 9 people but its Ok he's [pic]  https://t.co/ydbQghdI2

Ahmed makes a clock and hes a terrorist, but Dylan Roof shot black people and its OK!!!!!!1!!!!1!! Actually, nobody ever called Ahmed a terrorist and nobody ever said it was OK for Dylann Roof to shoot black people. Thats justsilliness soaked in nonsense dipped in horse manure and coated in intellectual dishonesty, but hey, it helps the narrative.
Notably, as all of this goes on, the other side of the story isnttaken into account or remotely considered at all. On that end, the school and the mayor of the townhave defended the handling of the situation. They say everyone followed protocols and did what they were supposed to do. It becomes a bit of a he said/he said scenario; a teenager and his activist family on one side, and administrators and police officers just trying to do their jobs on the other.Personally  no offense to Ahmed  but Im not sure he should be the one who gets the benefit of the doubt here.
After all, Ahmed claims that when he came into the room for interrogation, one of the cops, much like a villainfrom a movie, reclinedin his chair, took one look at his brown skin, and said, Yup, thats who I thought it was. This fantasticallegationhas been reported in headlines as absolute fact:
Texas Police Officer to Ahmed Mohamed After Arrest: Thats Who I Thought It Was
Maybe the cop said that. Or maybe this kid is, frankly, full of it. Clearly, someone in this situation is not telling the whole truth, and it seems likely that it might be the kid whosounds like hes repeating lines fed to him by his grievance-monger parents. Many people seem to have no problem always assuming the adults and the law enforcement officials are lying and the kids are always paragons of honesty, but as a former 14-year-old, I can report that such assumptions are ridiculous.
The cops say Ahmed wouldnt answer the questions and was being elusive and defiant. Ahmed says he was an innocent snowflake throughout the ordeal, bullied by cops who wore their anti-Arab prejudices on their sleeves. Maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle of the two extremes. Or maybe the police and the administrators decided to launch some bizarre crusade against clock-building Muslims. Or maybe Ahmed made a unwise decision to bring the clock to school, then when confronted by concerned authority figures became defiant and uncooperative, and later exaggerated certain elements of the story because its almost a 100 percent certainty that a child isnt going to admit he was in the wrong when theres 150 million people out there ready to hail him as a hero. Those are the three options here. Two of them seem reasonable, one seems a bit outlandish. But, sure, lets believe the most outlandish one and dismiss out of hand all the others for no reason at all.
Certainly, if you immediately jump to the less likely conclusion  that this was an anti-Islam conspiracy and the 14-year-old boy who got in hot waterat school isnt at all embellishing the details then it can only be because this conclusion fits a narrative. The narrative is the deciding factor, forever and always.
Indeed, nomatter how you feel about the police response, consider that kids in public school are frequently suspended, expelled, and/or arrested for far more trivial matters. Kids of all races  black, white, brown  have landed in serious, sometimes legal, trouble for spraying perfume, chewing a Pop Tart into the shape of a gun, kissing another student, bringing a leaf to school, packinga butter knifein a lunch box, pointing a finger, wearing an American flag t-shirt, shooting Nerf guns,burping, doodling, drawing a picture of Jesus, etc. Just this week, 23 students in Virginia were suspended for wearing Confederate flag apparel.
All of these offenses are, in my view, far less serious than bringing something that resembles a suitcase bomb to school. And in all of these cases, kids were arrested or suspended without any worldwide outrage, or any invitations to the White House, or any job offers from Twitter, or any prayer vigils. Why?
The answer is narrative.
One affirms a racial narrative, the others do not. Thats why Obama reaches out to the kidwith the clock that looks like an IED, but not the frat boys at the University of Virginia who were slandered all over the national media because of a feminist rape hoax. Thats why we still hearHands Up Dont Shoot shouted by fools, even though everyone knows Mike Brown said no such thing, as he was too busy trying to beat Officer Darren Wilson to death. Thats why the MatthewShepard murder is still cited to prove anti-gay hatred in the United States, despite the fact that Shephard was actually an addict killed by another homosexual over a drug dispute.
The narrative is all the matters. Truth is utterly irrelevant in progressivism.
Ironically, the narrative destroys itself in this case. If America is really teeming with ingrained Islamophobia, we wouldnt be making overnight celebrities of Muslim kids who get in trouble at school, while ignoring non-Muslim kids whove been in similar situations. It seemsapparent, once again, that Victim Group Status is a huge plus in America, unlike in the Middle East, where being in a Victim Group means being marched into the desert and executed with dynamite.
There is no Islamophobia epidemic. There might be an Islamophoniness (or Islamophonia, if you like) problem, but thats not part of the narrative.
And the narrative is all that matters.

When the VIX  an index of volatility in the S&P 500 stocks  hits levels in the high-twenties to low-thirties for extended periods of time, its usually an indicator that the U.S. economy is headed for a recession, according to a Goldman Sachs analyst.
Goldman Sachs released the graph below to put this issue into perspective  and as you can see, the index is currently at scary levels.

Goldman Sachs/Business Insider
VIX levels go back to January 1990. Since that time there have been three recessions. Average VIX levels in the first two recessions (1990-1991, 2001) were 25 and 26 respectively, Goldman Sachs analyst Krag Gregory said. The worst of the worst was of course the Great Financial Crisis. Average VIX levels in the 2008-2009 recession were 34.
After a dramatic spike during last weeks turbulent period, the VIX landed at 26 at the end of the week.
More insight from Business Insider:
Volatility in stock trading is not, on its own, an indicator of a decline in economic activity. But it does usually indicate that investors are nervous and twitchy about the way things are going, and thus trading their shares more frequently. That scenario often occurs right before the economy takes a nosedive.
[]
At the end of last week, the VIX stood at 26, even though Q2 GDP for the US was a healthy 3.7% and, and similarly robust levels of GDP growth are currently being seen in the major UK and European countries. The chart is doubtless driven by knock-on effects from the massive sell-off in China stocks. Those stocks are down because a lot ofanalysts doubt that Chinese economic growth is as strong as the government says it is.With the Chinese economic engine slowing down, the fear is that it might hurt growth worldwide.
In turn, the Chinese sell-off triggered a rollercoaster collapse-and-rally last week in the S&P 500.

In 1998, Matt Pollock lost his eyesight. In 2010, he fell tragically from a second-story window, suffering a spinal cord injury that paralyzed him from the waist down.
But he was determined to keep the paralyzed bits in good enough shape that Id be ready for any innovation that came down the track, he told the Los Angeles Times.

In 2014, that time came.
Pollock worked with researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, to become what is considered the first person with complete paralysis who had regained enough voluntary control assist a robotic mobility device in walking.

The robotic exoskeleton, made by Ekso Bionics,is a battery-operated suit that allows the wearer to take steps, controlling their legs, in part, with a noninvasive procedure that involves spinal stimulation.
In the last few weeks of the trial, my heart rate hit 138 beats per minute, Pollock said in a statement. This is an aerobic training zone, a rate I havent even come close to since being paralyzed while walking in the robot alone, without these interventions. That was a very exciting, emotional moment for me, having spent my whole adult life before breaking my back as an athlete.
Watch video of the accomplishment:
VIDEO
Prior to becoming paralyzed, Pollock became the first blind man to race in the South Pole and he has participated in other ultra-endurance races.
UCLA researchers observed Pollock actively assisting the robot in stepping  the robot wasnt doing all the heavy lifting.
It will be difficult to get people with complete paralysis to walk completely independently, but even if they dont accomplish that, the fact they can assist themselves in walking will greatly improve their overall health and quality of life, senior researcher V. Reggie Edgerton, a UCLA distinguished professor of integrative biology and physiology, neurobiology and neurosurgery, said in a statement.
He added that it will also likely be years before a system like this is widely available for patients with spinal cord injuries, but the hope is that its coming.
We think the future in robotics and rehabilitation is that the device will assist but will not completely take over, so the person has to regain some voluntary movement and to assist the device in making voluntary movements, Edgerton told the Los Angeles Times. The robot will do less and less and the subject will do more and more.
UCLAs research will be published by theIEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. The Los Angeles Times reported


President Barack Obamas decision to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin is a big mistake and a sign of weakness, said South Carolina presidential candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham.
I think this is a mistake and I think he is walking all over Obama in the Ukraine, the Republican from South Carolina told TheBlaze after speaking at the Values Voter Summit Saturday. I think this intrusion into the Ukraine on behalf of Assad is a nightmare for our national security interests. I think in the eyes of Putin, Obama is weak.

(AP Photo/Massoud Hossaini)
Obama and Putin, who have had a frosty relationship, will be meeting next week during the gathering of the United Nations General Assembly.The meeting comes after Russia has remained entangled in conflict with Ukraine for the past year and offered recent assistance to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.
This engagement with Putin is going to legitimize his entry into Syria, Graham said. Backing Assad is going to mean the war never ends. The radical Islamic groups that are in Syria today on the Sunni side are going to replace Assad as well as create a caliphate. He is allied with Iran. So Russia supporting Assad means the war continues. The Syrian people will not accept him as their legitimate leader.
So this is another example of how President Obamas foreign policy has significant, long term detrimental consequences, Graham continued. He has allowed Russia back into the Middle East in a strong way. I would not be meeting with Putin if I were president.


UPS Inc. says it will hire up to 95,000 seasonal workers this holiday season, the same as last year.
The international shipping company said Tuesday that it is looking to add between 90,0000 and 95,000 full-time and part-time seasonal workers,primarily package handlers, drivers and driver-helpers. The number of additional workers UPS plans to hire is the same number of anticipated new hires last year, according to CNN.

But according to Dan Mitchell, an economist for the libertarian Cato Institute,the number of extra employees one of the worlds largest shipping companies needs in order to fulfill holiday  orders reveals much more than just that.
The fact that we have a stagnant employment situation as measured by UPS seasonal hiring, you could say thats not a good reflection of the economy, Mitchell told TheBlaze on Tuesday.Were not expecting more packages to be shipped. Were not expecting more consumer spending, which presumably is a reflection of the fact that consumer income isnt climbing in a robust fashion.
However, as Mitchell also pointed out, those same dismal conclusions could also be drawn just by looking at other data.
While President Barack Obama and his supporters have repeatedly pointed to the unemployment  the lowest its been in seven years  Mitchell suggested the labor force participation rate provides a more accurate picture of economic conditions, showing that that number is the lowest its been in nearly 40 years.
Mitchell also pointed to government data released in 2014 showing the median U.S. household income at $51,939 in 2013, up from $51,759 the year before.
U.S. median income was $50,054 in 2011, a 1.5 percent drop from 2010.
Mitchell concluded that this anemic growth in recent years, as measured by these data and reinforced by the new UPS seasonal jobs numbers, is just one more indication of what Americans could expect in the coming years.
Those are much, much broader pieces of data but then this UPS job information certainly is yet another sign that we have this, as some people are calling it, the new normal, Mitchell said.
A UPS spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from TheBlaze.

Ex-day care teacher Ashlee Minchew was accused of encouraging kids to fight, taking video of them doing it and then posting the footage on social media, but she says it all was a misunderstanding.
Minchew said that she never actually shot the video of kids fighting at Childrens Universe of Lake Conroe near Houston last year  she just leaked it because she was angry about being fired over a different incident.
Regardless, theres video of kids fighting at what KTRK-TV called a day carefight cluband its disturbing.

Once parents of the children who were apparently encouraged to fight saw the video, they were furious and took legal action. The mother of at least one of the children is now suing the day care.
Attorney Greg Fibich, who is representing the mother in that case, said that its just shocking anything like this could happen.
Image source: KTRK-TV
She [the mother] did a lot of research about this facility and thought that her children were in safe hands, Fibich said.
Responding to the reports, the day cares owner released the following statement to KTRK-TV:
At the present time, we have not been made aware of any lawsuit. The incident in question occurred close to a year ago and was first reported to the authorities by myself and our director. We cooperated 100 percent in the investigation, which was closed by the police and Texas Department of Family and Protective Services several weeks later. The employee in question had been terminated for unrelated reasons prior to the initial report.
But that employee in question, Minchew, is maintaining her innocence as merely a whistleblowerand the law is on her side.
I wish I could just run to parents and be like, Look, it wasnt me filming! Im just the one who chose to leak it, Minchew, who now works as a nanny, said.
The Montgomery County District Attorneys Office did not accept any charges for Minchew. She was, however, a suspect in the Montgomery County Sheriffs Departments investigation.

Coordinated Universal Time or Atomic Time will add a leap second, making the clock on Tuesday night read11:59:60 p.m (or 23:59:60).
NASA explained that this second is being added to account for the slowing of Earths rotation, which is caused by natural events like earthquakes.
Technically, the solar day is 86,400 seconds long, but due to various factors, the average length of a day is really86,400.002seconds. According to NASA, the solar day hasnt really been 86,400 seconds since around 1820, which is why the leap seconds have been added since the 1970s.
Earths rotation is gradually slowing down a bit, so leap seconds are a way to account for that, Daniel MacMillan of NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center said in a statement.
Universal Time is measured by the electromagnetic transitions in atoms of cesium, NASA explained. The length of a day on Earth based on its rotation, however, is measured using a technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry.
As Earths rotation has slowed, to keep VLBItwo time standards within 0.9 seconds Universal Time, theInternational Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service occasionally decides to add a leap second, usually on June 30 or Dec. 31, according to NASA.
Watch this National Geographic video for more info about the leap second:
VIDEO
The last time a leap second was added in 2012, a few websites experienced outages. It also resulted in some flight delays.

Financial markets are preparing for the leap second in case it affects trading this time around.
In the short term, leap seconds are not as predictable as everyone would like,ChopoMa, NASA geophysicist and member of the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service board, said in a statement.
Google conducts a leap smear to make sure nothing bad happens to its site and services when these extra seconds are added:
We modified our internal [Network Time Protocol]servers to gradually add a couple of milliseconds to every update, varying over a time window before the moment when the leap second actually happens. This meant that when it became time to add an extra second at midnight, our clocks had already taken this into account, by skewing the time over the course of the day. All of our servers were then able to continue as normal with the new year, blissfully unaware that a leap second had just occurred. We plan to use this leap smear technique again in the future, when new leap seconds are announced by theIERS.
Judah Levine with the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technologyhas provided several exampleswhy he and some groups call for a stop to the practice of adding leap seconds.
Between 1972 and 1999, about one leap second per year was added. In the early 2000s though, that rate slowed, with Tuesdays leap second only being the fourth in the new millennium.
The modeling of the Earth predicts that more and more leap seconds will be called for in the long-term, but we cant say that one will be needed every year, Ma said.
Though you probably wont be able to do much with your extra second, here are a few ideas in case you want to honor it:
Click on this link to Time.gov to spot the extra leap second as it occurs.
Crack a smile at someone.
Take a nice, deep breath.
Consider it an extra second of sleep.


A Buffalo Wild Wings in Washington state has become the focus of a viral Internet post  all because of single beer.
Brian Avey, a server at the Buffalo Wild Wings in Tacoma, Washington, said a military woman came into the restaurant around lunchtime and attempted to order one Blue Moon and one Corona at the same time. But there was a problem: You cant do that.

When Avey explained the states law of only allowing one beer at a time, the female vet said that the Corona she ordered wasnt for her; it was for her brother who had died serving in Iraq.
Image source: KIRO-TV
Avey wrote on a now-viral Facebook post that the beer simply sat next to her at an empty place setting during the entirety of her lunch.
Buffalo Wild Wings picked up the tab for her brothers beer, but that wasnt the end of it.
After she left, I didnt have the heart to dump the beer out and throw it away, so I put it on top of the cooler next the American Flag, Avey wrote. When I showed my boss his response was Amazing He said Thats Fine, just do me a favor, put a fresh Lime in it Every Morning.

According to KIRO-TV, the store has been receiving calls of gratitude from all over the world.
Thank you. An act of kindness goes a long way. It means a lot to me. Have a great rest of your day, the woman, a grateful soldier wrote on the receipt before leaving the restaurant.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump fought back against assertions that he is thin skinned in an interview set to air in full on 60 Minutes Sunday.
Why so thin-skinned? CBS News anchor Scott Pelley asked the real estate tycoon.
Trump immediately responded with four words: I dont like lies.
Image source: Screen gab via CBS Evening News
He added, II dont mind a bad story. If you did a bad story on me for 60 Minutes, if it were a fair story I wouldnt be thin-skinned at all.
Trump said that some reporters are among the worst people hes ever encountered in his life.
I mean a pretty good percentage is really a terrible group of people. They write lies, they write false stories. They know theyre false. It makes no difference. And frankly I dont call it thin-skinned, Im angry, he told Pelley.

But a reporter asks you a couple of tough questions and the first debate and the whole week after that its war on that reporter, Pelley replied.
Well, I dont think those were fair questions, Trump said.
Pelley told Trump that an impression is created though that you like to dish it out but you cant take a punch.
Oh I think I can take it, Trump answered. II could take it if its fair. Again, if people say things that are false which happens a lot with me  if people say things that are false I will fight, like, harder than anybody. If I do something wrong, and that happens, and they write a fair story that I did something wrong, theres nothing to fight about. I can handle that. I dont like lying. You know Im a very honorable guy, I dont like lies.
Trump earned himself a reputation for being sensitive to media scrutiny by way of blasting news outlets and reporters who are critical of his campaign. The billionaire has gone after multiple Fox News personalities, National Reviews editor and Politico in recent days.

Something was missing from Pope Francis first visit to the White House  a 21-gun salute that the White House and Vatican thought wouldnt fit.
When planning events like this, the White House closely coordinates the activities with, in this case, the Vatican, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday. Obviously, this pope has a reputation of somebody who doesnt revel in pomp and circumstance as much as some other world leaders do and so it was in deference to his humility thatthat the 21-gun salute was not included in the formal arrival ceremony today.

A 21-gun military salute is common for world leaders, includingPope Benedict, whoreceived the tribute during his 2008 White House visit.
Some might also recognize the dissonance in welcoming a professed man of peace to the White House by, you know, by the repeated firing of weapons, Earnest said of Pope Francis ceremony Wednesday morning on the South Lawn. I think that we felt a slightly more subdued welcoming ceremony was the most apportioate way to welcome Pope Francis to the White House, and based solely on his public reaction to the festivities, it appears that Pope Francis agreed with that.


Presidential candidate Donald Trump blasted the Club for Growth Tuesday night on Twitter, claiming the pro-free market organization once asked him to write them a check for $1 million.
Trump said that when he was asked for the donation, he said, No way! The billionairecontended that following the alleged exchange, the organization became nasty toward him.

The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N.Y.C. and asked for a ridiculous $1,000,000 contribution. I said no way!
 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2015

When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1,000,000, they got nasty.What a waste of money that would have been
 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2015

But, the Club for Growth didnt take the online attack from Trump quietly. In its own tweet, the organization disputed Trumps claim and hurled its own insult at Trump.
Actually @realDonaldTrump asked for that mtg & then asked for races he could support. Thought he could buy us off. Worst Kind of Politician

Raising the minimum wage has been a hot topic among Democrats this year. So we wondered: if America has a minimum wage, do some also think the U.S. needs a cap on how much money an individual can earn?
We polled people in New York and Virginia on the subject. Watch the results of our survey.


Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of famed preacher Billy Graham, decried a decision by Oregon officialsto fine bakers Aaron and Melissa Klein $135,000 for refusing to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple, calling it unbelievable.
Brad Avakian, Oregons Bureau of Labor & Industries Commissioner, upheld the ruling that the Kleins have to pay the lesbian couple $135,000 for a long list of alleged damages including: acute loss of confidence, high blood pressure, impaired digestion, loss ofappetite, migraine headaches, pale and sick at home after work, resumption of smoking habit, weight gain, and worry, Graham wrote. Give me a break.



The evangelist said that, in his opinion, it should beRachel Cryer-Bowman and Laurel Bowman-Cryer  the women who were refused a cake by the bakery  who, instead, write a $135,000 check to the Kleins for all theyve been through.
Graham also claimed that Avakian has ordered the Kleins to cease and desist from speaking publicly about not wanting to bake cakes for same-sex weddings based on their Christian beliefs  an act that he said is a direct assault on free speech.
He encouraged Christians to pray for the family and for other Bible-believers who find themselves in similar situations here in America.

As TheBlaze previously reported, Aaron Klein saidjust hours after officials announced that he and his wife, owners of Sweetcakes by Melissa,would be fined $135,000that he has no plans of backing down.
He wants to silence anyone who opposes his point of view,Klein told TheBlaze, speaking specifically about Avakian.Unfortunately, hes doing this with the wrong Christian, because I fight back.

A prominent Islamic preacher named Hamza Andreas Tzortzis says his personal information was leaked in the recent Ashley Madison hack  but insists that hes never used the adultery website.

Tzortzis, who sympathized with a group that called for an Islamic caliphate as recently as 2010, wrote in a Facebook post that his name, address and bank card details were among the millions published last week, the U.K.s Express reported.
This is an obvious case of fraud. My email address (this website doesnt verify emails and all the relevant emails went to junk) can be found online and so can my address, as it is linked to my business account, which is registered online. My date of birth is known from either previous lectures or Facebook, Tzortzis wrote.
The Facebook post is no longer visible but one Reddit user archived the post here.

Tzortzis says his whereabouts and activities are traceable and recorded, and that his professional and social meetings are public and with people who can confirm his presence. He went on to speculate as to who might be responsible.
It could have been someone who knows me, someone who hates me, or a malicious person who found out who I was, Tzortzis wrote.It could be one person or two, they could be working locally, from abroad or both.
He further denied that he used the website to find another wife, which is allowed under Islam, but heavily criticized by him in the past.
Tzortzis once said that anyone who does not convert to Islam should be punished and that beheading is painless, both statements for which he later apologized, the Express reported.
But the Muslim preacher has taken a much more conservative stance than others, having also once said thatsex outside of marriage, wife-swapping and swingers parties are not withinthe Islamic vision of society.
He has also called homosexuality a crime and compared it withcannibalism, paedophilia and incest, according to the Express. Tzortzis was associated with the Islamic political party,Hizb ut Tahrir, which advocates for all Muslim countries to unite under one ruler.

A Boston-area man was overly excited  and overly Boston  after he caught a sea monstah during a recent fishing trip.
In the now viral videoposted to his Facebook page, Michael Bergin unleashed his excitement with a bevy of expletives over the catch of what he thought was a sea turtle or a baby f***ing whale. According to Mashable, Bergin actually caught an ocean sunfish, and it was very much alive.
Its Moby Dick! Bergin exclaimed at one point.
Screen grab via Facebook video
Bergin told the Boston Globe that his reaction in the video, which has been viewed more than 114,000 times, was completely genuine.
I aint seen nothing like that in my entire life, bro, he told the Boston Globe. I aint even been to the aquarium. When I see something like that, Im amazed, bro. Its like seeing a gorilla for the first time, man.
I dont know, man. I went nuts. We didnt know what the hell it was, Bergin continued. It was scaring me to death. It was like a dinosaur. It was so  ugly.
Bergin was fishing with his friend, Jason Foster, who told the Globe that Bergins continuous swearing is pretty normal for the 41-year-old. Foster said he was laughing the entire time during Bergins episode.
The Globe reported that the two men attempted to get the fish onboard their boat but eventually had to contact the Coast Guard to alert them of what they had caught.

Its arguably not the prettiest or palatable of research, but the work being done at North Carolina State University on a particularly nasty virus leads to better understanding of its spread and, thus, how it could be contained in the future.
In a fume hood in NC StatesNoroCORE lab is a box with a modeled head smaller than the size of a human hand. That head with an opened mouth is attached to a tube that shoots a virus-laced liquid into the box that has various sensors to take measurements of the simulated projectile vomit.

Researcher Grace Tung-Thompson at North Carolina States NoroCORE Lab stands in front of the vomiting machine they created to simulate projectile vomiting and measure any virus in the air. (Image source: North Carolina State University)
The NoroCORE team published a study this week in which they used their barf box to show how the norovirus  a virus that can be spread in contaminated food, on surfaces and from person-to-person contact  canaerosolize.
Epidemiological evidence has pointed to virus aerosolization during vomiting as a likely route for spreading norovirus, and our work here confirms that its not only possible but probable, Dr. Lee-Ann Jaykus, a professor of food, bioprocessing and nutrition sciences at the university, said in a statement.
When one person vomits, the aerosolized virus particles can get into another persons mouth and, if swallowed, can lead to infection, Jaykus said. But those airborne particles could also land on nearby surfaces like tables and door handles, causing environmental contamination. And norovirus can hang around for weeks, so anyone that touches that table and then puts their hand to their mouth could be at risk for infection.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the norovirus causesacute gastroenteritis, which leads to stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea and to throw up. It is considered a type of food poisoning, but there are other bugs that cause food poisoning as well, the CDC stated. Symptoms usually develop within 12 to 48 hours after exposure to the virus and a person is usually feeling better between one to three days after symptoms first appear.
Using fake vomit contaminated with a virus similar to the norovirus but that is not harmful to humans, the researchers found that while not a lot of virus was aerosolized in terms of percentage, it was definitely enough to cause an infection.
At most, only 0.02 percent of the total virus in the vomit was aerosolized, Jaykus said. But that can still amount to thousands of virus particles  more than enough to infect other people.
Watch this video about how the vomiting machine works:
VIDEO
What does this mean for other viruses that are not considered to have airborne transmission? During the thick of the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, health officials strongly stated that for the virus to spread, a person would need to come into direct contact with infected bodily fluids.
The CDC has stated that there is no evidence that Ebola is spread by coughing or sneezing and that it is not transmitted through theair. Large droplets though, it said, of respiratory or other secretions from a person who is sick with Ebola could be infectious.
Jaykus told TheBlaze in a phone interview that she would not necessarily expect the Ebola virus to be aerosolized in the same manner as the norovirus because of its larger size and other structural elements.
The machine would be relevant for testing that hypothesis, she said though, noting that the lab doing so would need to have the highest of biosafety clearances. I think based on structure of the virus, based on its size  and without the knoweldge as to whether its present in vomit  would suggest to me that if it is aersolized, it would be less efficient than norovirus.
As for the vomit machine itself, Jaykus said that outside of another vomit simulator known as Vomiting Larry in the U.K., she doesnt know of other researchers working with a similar machine. If youre wondering about the head, Jaykus said its more than just a joke.
I thought it was a joke just to make it a little bit more friendly, but it actually does have something of a function, she said. Tubing that goes from artificial stomach into sort of the mouth of little head is designed to mimic the angle that we would be in if we vomited. You have to have the right angle to that tube and the head does provide a bit of a weight in order to keep that angle appropriate.
According to NC States news release, further research on aerosolized viruses include how long the virus can remain in the air and how far it travels. For now, these findings, the researchers wrote in the study published in the journal PLOS One, have implications for better understanding the transmission dynamics of human NoV and for risk modeling purposes, both of which can help in designing effective infection control measures.
Check out this animation that shows how far sneeze particles can travel on an airplane.

Caught up in the spectacle of the forthcoming 2016 presidential elections, Americans (never very good when it comes to long-term memory) have not only largely forgotten last years hullabaloo over militarized police, police shootings of unarmed citizens, asset forfeiture schemes and government surveillance but are also generally foggy about everything that has happened since.
Then again, so much is happening on a daily basis that its understandable if the average American has a hard time keeping up with and remembering all of the events  manufactured or otherwise  that occur like clockwork and keep us distracted, deluded, amused and insulated from reality while the government continues to amass more power and authority over the citizenry.

In fact, when were being bombarded with wall-to-wall news coverage and news cycles that change every few days, its difficult to stay focused on one thing  namely, holding the government accountable to abiding by the rule of law  and the powers-that-be understand this.
Consider the regularly scheduled trivia and/or distractions in the past year alone that have kept us tuned in to the various breaking news headlines and entertainment spectacles and tuned out to the governments steady encroachments on our freedoms:
York County Police ride on an armored vehicle on their way to the scene of standoff in Hanover, Pennsylvania. (AP Photo/York Daily Record, Jason Plotkin)
Americans were riveted when the Republican presidential contenders went head-to-head for the second time in a three-hour debate; scientists announced the discovery of what they believed to be a new pre-human species, Homo naledi, that existed 2.8 million years ago; and President Obama and Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg tweeted their support for a Texas student arrested for bringing a homemade clock to school.
That was preceded by an immigration crisis in Europe and three Americans being hailed as heroes for thwarting a train attack in France; the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina statehouse; shootings at a military recruiting center in Tennessee and a movie theater in Louisiana; the Boy Scouts decision to end its ban on gay adult leaders; and the victory over Japan of the U.S. in the Womens World Cup soccer finals.
Before that, there was a shooting at a Charleston, S.C., church; the trial and sentencing of Boston Marathon bomber suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; the U.S. Supreme Courts affirmation of same-sex marriage, Obamacare, lethal injection drugs and government censorship of Confederate flag license plates; and an Amtrak train crash in Philadelphia that left more than 200 injured and eight dead.
Also included in the mix of distressing news coverage was the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray while in police custody; the ongoing saga of Hillary Clintons use of a private email account; the crash of a German jetliner in the French Alps; a measles outbreak in Disneyland; a terror attack at the Paris office of Charlie Hebdo; the disappearance of an AirAsia flight over the Java Sea; an Ebola outbreak; and the reported beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff by ISIS.
That doesnt even begin to touch on the spate of entertainment news that tends to win the battle for Americans attention: Bruce Jenners transgender transformation to Caitlyn Jenner; Kim Kardashians break the internet nude derriere photo; sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby; cancellation of the comedy The Interview in movie theaters after alleged terror hack threats; the wedding of George Clooney to Amal Alamuddin; the wedding of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt; the ALS ice bucket challenge; and the birth of a baby girl to Prince William and Kate.
As I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, these sleight-of-hand distractions, diversions and news spectacles are how the corporate elite controls a population by entrapping them in the crisis of the NOW, either inadvertently or intentionally, advancing their agenda without much opposition from the citizenry.
But what exactly has the government  aided and abetted by the mainstream media  been doing while weve been so cooperatively fixated on whatever current sensation happens to be monopolizing the so-called news shows?
If properly disclosed, consistently reported on and properly digested by the citizenry, the sheer volume of the governments activities, which undermine the Constitution and in many instances are outright illegal, would inevitably give rise to a sea change in how business is conducted in our seats of power.
Surely Americans would be concerned about the Obama administrationsplans to use behavioral science tactics to nudge citizens to complywith the governments public policy and program initiatives? There would be no end to the uproar if Americans understood the ramifications of the governments plan to train non-medical personnel  teachers, counselors and other lay people  in mental first aid in order totrain them to screen, identify and report individuals suspected of suffering from mental illness. The problem, of course, arises when these very same mental health screeners misdiagnose opinions or behavior involving lawful First Amendment activities as a mental illness, resulting in involuntary detentions in psychiatric wards for the unfortunate victims.

Parents would be livid if they had any inkling about the school-to-prison pipeline, namely, how the public schools are being transformed from institutions of learning to prison-like factories, complete with armed police and surveillance cameras, aimed atchurning out compliant test-takersrather than independent-minded citizens. And once those same young people reach college, they will be indoctrinated into believing that they have aright to be free from acts and expressions of intolerancewith which they might disagree.
Concerned citizens should be up in arms over the governments end-run tactics to avoid abiding by the rule of law, whether byoutsourcing illegal surveillance activitiesto defense contractors,outsourcinginhumane torture to foreign countries,causing American citizens to disappearinto secret interrogation facilities or establishing policies that wouldallow the military to indefinitely detain any citizen including journalists  considered a belligerent or an enemy.
And one would hope American citizens would be incensed about being treated like prisoners in an electronic concentration camp, their every movement monitored, tracked and recorded by a growing government surveillance network that runs the gamut from traffic cameras and police body cameras to facial recognition software. Or outraged that we will be forced to fund a $93 billion drone industry that will be used to spy on our movements and activities, not to mention the fact that private prisons are getting rich (on our taxpayer dollars) by locking up infants, toddlers, children and pregnant women?
Unfortunately, while 71 percent of American voters are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States, that discontent has yet to bring about any significant changes in the government, nor has it caused the citizenry to get any more involved in their government beyond the ritualistic Election Day vote.
Professor Morris Berman suggests that the problems plaguing us as a nation  particularly as they relate to the government  have less to do with our inattention to corruption than our sanctioning, tacit or not, of such activities. It seems to me, writes Berman, that the people do get the government they deserve, and even beyond that, the government who they are, so to speak.
In other words, if we end up with a militarized police state, it will largely be because we welcomed it with open arms. In fact, according to a recent poll, almost a third of Americans would support a military coup to take control from a civilian government which is beginning to violate the constitution.
So where does that leave us?
As legendary television journalist Edward R. Murrow warned, Unless we get up off our fat surpluses and recognize that television in the main is being used to distract, delude, amuse and insulate us, then television and those who finance it, those who look at it, and those who work at it, may see a totally different picture too late.

Pope Francis received a standing ovation for statements he made about the responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development, but there was a word that was notably missing from his lengthy address to Congress: abortion.
The pontiff, whose comment about protecting lifewas seen by many as a fleeting anti-abortion reference, avoided patently using the term, and also declined to specifically address issues related to the ongoing debate over the unborn.




The Golden Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development, Pope Francis said. This conviction has led me, from the beginning of my ministry, to advocate at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty.
He continued, I am convinced that this way is the best, since every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes.

While Pope Francis did address other subjects such as the refugee crisis, immigration, the environment, the weapons trade and the death penalty in detail duringhis3,400-word address,pro-life sentiment was notably absent from his remarks.
Gay marriage and same-sex marriage were also terms that were absent from the pontiffs address, though the associated issues were most certainly addressed toward the end of his remarks.
How essential the family has been to the building of this country! And how worthy it remains of our support and encouragement! he said. Yet I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family.
The popecontinued, I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life.
Watch Pope Francis remarks about the death penalty below:
VIDEO
The pontiff did address the innocent victim of abortion during a speech on Wednesday to U.S. bishops who had assembledat the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, D.C., and he has repeatedly spoken about the issue in the past.
The innocent victim of abortion, children who die of hunger or from bombings, immigrants who drown in the search for a better tomorrow, the elderly or the sick who are considered a burden, the victims of terrorism, wars, violence and drug trafficking, the environment devastated by mans predatory relationship with nature  at stake in all of this is the gift of God, of which we are noble stewards but not masters, Pope Francis told the bishops on Wednesday, according to prepared remarks.

There are several institutions developing exoskeletons to do everything from helpingparalyzed individuals walk again to easing the burden on soldiers carrying heavy loads over long distances.
What is it like to wear one though?
IEEE Spectrum, which was on hand at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Groundin Marylandto witness a recent, three-mile test of one such system, learned that while it took some getting used to, soldiers could feel the difference.
The battery-operated system is mean to help ease a heavy load and reduce muscle strain. (Image source: YouTube)
Its like a rubber band, Army Specialist Cacciatoresaid in an IEEE Spectrum video. You can feel tension, but once it gets stopped, it helps pull your leg up and helps relieve tension off the muscle.When you dont wear the machine you feel all that weight on your muscle.
Speaking honestly, Cacciatoresaid hes not sure how the exoskeleton would affect soldier performance, but medically, he thinks it would be beneficial.

A report on a conservative political news website suggesting outgoing Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) cut a deal with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) before his exit is false, a person inside Boehners office with knowledge of the situation told TheBlaze.
In the immediate aftermath of Boehners resignation announcement, Breitbart published a story about a rumor swirling on Capitol Hill that indicated a deal had been struck between the two party leaders to continue funding some of President Barack Obamas most controversial measures.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has clashed with Boehner in the past, added fuel to the fire by repeating the rumor while at the conservative Values Voter Summit.
I will say, the early reports are discouraging. If it is correct that the speaker, before he resigns, has cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of its tenure, to fund Obamacare, to fund executive amnesty, to fund Planned Parenthood, to fund implementation of this Iran deal  and then, presumably, to land in a cushy K Street job after joining with the Democrats to implement all of President Obamas priorities, that is not the behavior one would expect of a Republican speaker of the House, Cruz said.
Asked if the report were true, a Boehner aide who spoke to TheBlaze on the condition of anonymity said, Not at all, as is typical of [Breitbart.]
The aide said that the Senate has demonstrated it cannot pass defunding of Planned Parenthood and will pass a clean continuing resolution that will be brought to the House and passed with bipartisan support.
House GOP will pursue the budget reconciliation process to defund Planned Parenthood and break Senate Dems logjam, the aide said. This is the strategy that will actually advance the pro-life movement, as National Right to Life has articulated.
The Boehner aide also took some shots at Breitbart and one of its star reporters, Matthew Boyle. Breitbart and Boyle are known to publish inflammatory stories highly critical of anyone that doesnt toe the hardline-conservative view.
I have nothing against Daniel Webster, but it is hilarious to me that Breitbart is trumpeting the fact that he is running for speaker, the aide told TheBlaze, referring to Florida Congressman Daniel Webster. Webster has endorsed Jeb Bush.
I can see the Boyle headline now, the person continued. EXCLUSIVE: BREITBART.COM PUSHES JEB SUPPORTER FOR SPEAKER.
Boehner is set to resign from Congress at the end of next month.

A man has been charged with misdemeanor use of a weapon after a group of pro-life protesters who were praying outside of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Aurora, Illinois, claim that he pulled out a gun as he was entering the building.
Protesters said that the purported incident unfolded early on Saturday morning, as around 40 pro-life activists were praying across the street from the building.
Thats when Clifton Ratney, 21, allegedly flashed his gun as he walked toward the Planned Parenthood facility, reportedly later telling police that he did so due to the fact that the pro-life protesters were shouting toward him, the Chicago Tribune reported.
Watch video that captured the purported incident below:
VIDEO
Ratney  who wasaccompanying a woman inside of the clinic when the alleged incident unfolded  is said to have pulled a 9mm Smith & Wesson handgun, putting it to his chest before once again concealing it and entering the building.
In a Live Action report that did not name Ratney, but that described a similar incident that unfolded at the same clinic over the weekend, pro-life protester Troy Buccini said that he was among those calling out to the couple, andthat he continued to plead with them to keep their child and leave the abortion clinic,even after the gun had been pulled.
After protesters called authorities, police found Ratney in the Planned Parenthood waiting room and he reportedly admitted to having the gun.
One of the pro-lifers called police, Buccini told Live Action News. He was arrested and the baby was spared for that day, at least.
While Ratney did have an Indiana Conceal Carry license, he did not have a non-resident license, and was charged with disorderly conduct and unlawful use of a weapon, according to the Chicago Tribune.

It turns out the gas-guzzling truck you like to drive so much might not be as bad for the environment as previously thought by some.
A new study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research has found that the emissions put off from power plants supplying energy to electric cars while they charge could actually be causing just as much environmental harm as traditional vehicles that pipe out exhaust along the highway.

Its kind of hard to beat gasoline, co-author and University of Minnesota professorJulian Marshall said.A lot of the technologies that we think of as being cleanare not better than gasoline.
Image source: National Bureau of Economic Research
Researchers looked at a number of different factors and compiled the data into map that shows where electric vehicles do more harm than good and vice versa. The areas colored in red show the parts of the country in which electric vehicles are worse than traditional fuel-powered cars while the areas in green show where they are having the most positive impact.
Researchers used 11 different 2014 electric car models and substitute fuel-powered vehicles while looking at five types of pollutants, includingcarbon, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen, particulate matter and volatile organic compounds.
They also took into account the fuel-efficiency ratings of traditional vehicles, along with environmental factors such as wind patterns, which also contribute to the quality of air. Using those data, they calculated how much it costs to drive each of the car models  electric and fuel-powered  for one mile in every county of every state.
The study noted that in places like Los Angeles, electric cars are 3.3 cents per mile better for the environment but that in more densely populated areas like New York City, electric cars are 1.5 cents worse than traditional fuel-powered cars.

Researchers noted that the federal government currently pays out $7,500 for every electric vehicle sold and suggested that it makes more sense economically to get rid of that particular financial incentive.
Because electric vehicles, on average, generate greater environmental externalities than gasoline vehicles, the current federal policy has greater deadweight loss than the no-subsidy policy, the authors of the study said.

The Florida gun shop owner who planned to create a Muslim-free zone at his business said he has invited a leader of the Council on American-Islamic Relations to attend his gun class on Saturday and plans to study the Koran with him afterward.
Florida Gun Supply owner Andy Hallinantold Tampas WTVT-TV that after the executive director of CAIRs Florida office, Hassan Shibly, contacted him, the two agreed that Shibly would come up and listen to me teach about guns, and hes going to take my class.

Afterwards were going to sit down and were going study the Koran a little bit together. Hes very confident that he can sway my position on what I believe that Islam is. Im not so sure, but Im definitely open and willing to have that kind of conversation with him, Hallinan said.
VIDEO
He believes he can sway my opinion on the Koran and on Islam in general, and he believes that Im taking the portions of the Koran that Ive studied out of context, Hallinan told WTVT.
The shop owner said his opinions on Islam stem from studying the religion over years.
Im totally open-minded to the ideas that hes presenting, but Im doubling down on my position. I have definitely researched  Islam over the last six years, and Ive found it to be a violent, hateful religion and if he can convince me otherwise, all the power to him, Hallinan said.
Of his viral Facebook video over the weekend, in which he announced that in response to the Chattanooga shooting he would no longer serve Muslims as a matter of maintaining community safety, Hallinan explained, The intent of video was to offend as many people as I could to start the conversation about violence, religion and theocracy and open up and expose the truth behind this religion.
I believe that Islam is a violent, hateful theocracy that is designed to take over the world and kill as many non-believers as they can, Hallinan said.
Responding to the video, CAIRs Shibly told Orlandos WOFL-TVthat the commentswere very hurtful. I dont want my kids to grow up thinking that there are some places that are off-limits to them simply because of the religion they choose to follow and practice.
CAIR has asked the Justice Department to investigate the shop over possible civil rights violations.
The great thing about America is we can practice whatever faith we want to practice or no faith at all and yet we shouldnt face discrimination or harassment or abuse simply because of how we practice our faith, Shibly said.

Now, Hallinansaid he also plans to host an interfaith meeting with Muslims next month to ask open questions about Islam in a polite respectful manner.
The plans for the gun and Koran lessons came about after his conversation with the CAIR official, which Hallinan described as wonderful.
He and I were both surprised that we could reach across and communicate as effectively as we did, Hallinan said.
Though he planned to host the two meetings with adherents of the Muslim faith, Hallinan said that at this point he is confident his shop will continue to be a Muslim-free zone.
Clarifying his comments, Hallinan explained that while he had no plans to ask customers what faith they practice, if he feels uneasy, he will not serve that customer.

ABC News Good Morning America showed a seven-minute preview Friday of an exclusive story on the O.J. Simpson civil trial deposition tapes, set to air the same night on ABCs 20/20. Then NBC News revealed an embarrassing truth to its broadcast rival.
NBC News was actually the first to air the tapes on Dateline  16 years ago.
The ABC News story flashed the headline never before seen videos revealed ascorrespondent Elizabeth Vargas launched into her introduction by telling viewers they were about to hear some of Simpsons chilling testimony about his relationship with his ex-wife, Nicole, for the first time.
These tapes were locked away for 20 years in an underground storage facility, gathering dust, Vargas reported.
VIDEO
NBC was quick to pounce. It issued a tweet at 8:51 a.m. Friday, less than two hours after the ABC News report aired, calling out 20/20 and Good Morning America for partying like its 1999, referring to the year in which NBC first aired the tapes.
Oh, hey @abc2020 @GMA partying like its 1999! Check out #Dateline logo from first time we aired the tapes! #retro pic.twitter.com/DviibfLCym

Washington Post media columnist Erik Wemple blasted ABCs egregious error in a blog post published a couple of hours after the network was called out on Twitter for the atrocity.
As journalistic malpractice goes, this is a misdemeanor, though an annoying one, Wemple wrote. News outlets  especially in the TV sector  are forever touting the thinnest exclusives, to the point that any eye-rolling media reporter learns to take a pass on harrumphing about most such atrocities.
Yet there is an important factual matter here, Wemple added, in that ABC News marveled before its viewers about how these tapes just managed to fade into oblivion. That was way off.
ABC News later apologized for the mistake, saying that it had only found out that same morning that NBC had aired the story more than a decade ago.
We were wrongly under the impression these deposition tapes were exclusive and had not aired before at length. We learned this morning portions did air 15 years ago.We apologize for the mistake, an ABC News representative told the Post.

Defense contractor Lockheed Martin launched its ninthlittoral combat ship for the U.S. Navy over the weekend into theMenominee River in Wisconsin.
When you see just how this massive vessel makes it from dry land into the water, it seems like quite a nail-biting moment, especially when you consider that it cost about $360 million to build.
Ships being launched in this slide fashion are not without their snafus, as weve seen before.
TheUSS Little Rockby Lockheed Martin was christened with the traditional smashing of a bottle of champagne andlaunched sideways at the Marinette Marine Corporation shipyard with a splash Saturday.
Image source: YouTube
Watch the dramatic launch:
VIDEO
It is such an honor and a privilege to serve as the sponsor of the future USS Little Rock and to be a part of this major milestone along the way to her assuming her place as part of the great U.S. Navy fleet, the ships sponsor Janee Bonner said in astatement.
The ship isnt quite ready for Navy use yet. For the next few months, Lockheed will outfit and test the ship before delivering it later this year.
This future USS Little Rock will use interchangeable mission modules that empower her to face a variety of high-priority missions, from Anti-Surface Warfare to Anti-Submarine Warfare to Mine Countermeasures, Vice President of Littoral Ships and Systems Joe North said in a statement. She is ideally suited to navigate the reefs and shallows in the Asia-Pacific, as so well demonstrated by USS Fort Worth on her current deployment.
Some of the key features of thelittoral combat ships from Lockheed include its:

Ability to operate with a small number of crew members
Top speed of 40 knots
Rolling-airframe missile launching system
57mm main gun
Mine and torpedo detection system
Decoy capabilities



Presidential contender Donald Trump scoffed at rival GOP contender Carly Fiorina and took a shot at her physical appearance when video of the former Hewlett-Packard CEO appeared on the news, according to a Rolling Stone report.
Look at that face! he reportedly exclaimed while watching her speak on the news. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!

The real estate tycoon continued as his staffers laughed, according to the Rolling Stone report.
I mean, shes a woman, and Im not sposedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on, Trump reportedly said. Are we serious?
During the first GOP debate, Fiorina blasted Trump, noting that the billionaire had received a call from former President Bill Clinton before he announced his run for office. In the debate aftermath, Fiorina was also the first candidate to come to Fox News host Megyn Kellys defense following Trumps blood comment.
Trump and Fiorina will likely face off on the main debate stage next week at the CNN debate.

Pope Francis visited the9/11 Memorial and Museum during his first-ever trip to the United States on Friday, where he participated in an interfaith prayer event, imploring those in the audience to reject hate and violence and to embrace a spirit of reconciliation.
Before the event, the pontiff met with families of first responders who bravely rushed to assist in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, with Pope Francis later offering a prayer that God granteternal light and peace to all who died during the attacks.
His brief invocation followed reflections fromRabbi Elliot Cosgrove of the Park Avenue Synagogue, and Imam Khalid Latif, a chaplain at New York University, and came before additional meditations and prayers from the Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh traditions.

He laterdelivered briefremarks, highlighting the many emotions that he experienced at the former site of the World Trade Center  a placewhere he said that grief is palpable.


Water falling also symbolizes our tears, the tears shed for destructions of yesterday who are joined by so much destruction today,he said, referencing the memorial, which features flowing fountains.It is water that reminds us of yesterdays tears.
The pontiff said that the memorial is a place where individuals mourn the September 11 attacks, decrying the death of the innocent because we were not able to find solutions for the common good.
In addition to the pain that the memorial represents, Pope Francis said that it also offers remembrance of the heroic goodness that came from those who worked diligently to save others in the wake of the attack, calling the site both a place of death and of life.

At that time it wasnt about blood, or origin, or neighborhood, or origin or political views. It was a matter of solidarity  it was a matter of humanity, he said. New York firemen and women came into the towers that were crumbling without much thinking about their own lives. Many fell in their duty and with their sacrifice they allowed for so many others to survive.
After proclaiming that it is possible to live in a world of peace, Pope Francis then called for a moment of silence and prayer, imploring individuals to do so as they saw fit.

MECCA, Saudi Arabia (TheBlaze/AP)  At least 717 people have been killed in a stampede at the annual hajj pilgrimage, according toSaudi Arabias civil defense directorate.
The directorate says at least 805 other pilgrims were injured in Thursdays stampede, which took place in Mina, on the outskirts of the holy city of Mecca. The initial deal toll was reported to be 150, but quickly rose to 717.

Some 2 million people are taking part in this years hajj pilgrimage, which began Tuesday.
In this image posted on the official Twitter account of the directorate of the Saudi Civil Defense agency, a pilgrim is treated by a medic after a stampede that killed and injured pilgrims in the holy city of Mina during the annual hajj pilgrimage on Thursday, Sept. 24, 2015. (Directorate of the Saudi Civil Defense agency via AP)
Millions of Muslims converge to Saudi Arabia to visit Mecca and Medina each year for the hajj, an annual pilgrimage that, due to its massive attendance, many times poses major security and safety concerns.
The deal toll on Thursday comes after 107 people were killed just before the hajj earlier this month after a crane collapsed in the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
This is not the first year in which a deadly incident has unfolded during the hajj. Back in 2006, 360 pilgrims were killed during a stampede near Mecca, 244 died in 2004 and 35 died during a stampede in 2001.
But the biggest death toll came during a 1990 stampede in which 1,426 people died in a tunnel leading to Meccas holy sites.
The hajj is a mandatory pilgrimage that is one of the Five Pillars of Islam  a requirement that every Muslim do at least one time during his or her life.

NEW YORK (AP)  Delta Air Lines had a major change of heart about shipping hunting trophies, announcing Monday afternoon that it would no longer accept lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros and buffalo trophies.
As recently as May, the Atlanta-based airline had said that it would continue to allow such shipments  as long as they were legal. At the time, some international carriers prohibited such cargo.

Image source: Shutterstock
The move comes after an American dentist killed a well-known lion named Cecil in Zimbabwe last month in an allegedly illegal hunt, setting off a worldwide uproar. The dentist, Walter James Palmer, lives in Minnesota, which is a major hub for Delta.
Delta has the most flights of any U.S. airline to Africa. Several foreign airlines announced similar bans last week.
Delta would not answer questions from The Associated Press about why the decision was made now and how many hunting trophies it has shipped in recent years. The company only issued a 58-word statement noting that prior to Mondays ban, Deltas strict acceptance policy called for absolute compliance with all government regulations regarding protected species.
Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry consultant, noted that the airline was probably responding to pressure following the news of Cecils killing. The airline was the subject of a petition on change.org to ban such shipments.
I dont think there was much of this shipment taking place, so there is minimal revenue loss and big PR gain for them, he said.

A Michigan man was on abe-on-the-lookout alert issued by Ann Arbor police early Thursday.
Later that morning, a 19-year-old man matching his description was sitting on the edge of a strip malls roof  his feet dangling off it  in Pittsfield Township,MLive reported, just a few miles south of Ann Arbor.

I think it was crazy,Ashley Parker, store manager of the malls Dollar General, told WXYZ-TV.Idont know how in the heck he got up there.
The man was threatening to jump, the station added.
But Pittsfield Township Police officer Jack Pattwell was soon communicating with the man, who agreed to let him come up to the roof,MLive said.
Patwell and another officer,Mike McVicker, got to the roof using a fire department ladderbut then the man began moving closer to the roofs edge, MLive said.
Some cellphone images appear to show the man not sitting but standing as an officer moved in behind him.

Finally, Pattwell was able to grab the man and pull him from the edge, MLive said  a moment that was caught on cellphone video.

At the close of the last term for United States Supreme Court, the high court in Michigan vs. EPA took the unusual step of telling the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider a major environmental regulation because the agency failed to consider the cost of that regulation before unrolling their red tape rolls.
That decision takes place against the backdrop of another proposed regulation where two environmental regulatory authoritiesthe EPA in Washington and the California equivalentare preparing to move independently toward issuing stringent new rules against a compound that is both manmade and naturally occurring. This compound, present in the earth long before humans ever began manufacturing it for industrial and defense-related purposes, poses no threat to public health in most cases where humans come into contact with it, but the clean-up will cost tax payers tens of billions of dollars if the proposed regulations take effect.

If the chemical name perchlorate doesnt ring a bell, dont worry. Its a relatively obscure compound that is manufactured mostly for defense applications, but it is also occurs naturally across the country at relatively low levels.
Most observers expect U.S. EPA and California EPA to dramatically lower the allowable levels of perchlorate in water. Regulators will impose significant costs on water systems across the country to test and treat drinking water to meet this unnecessary new standard. Worse still, these tightened regulations would have no discernible impact on public health, according to current and former EPA officials.
The decision to regulate will also dramatically increase the prices of many agricultural and commodity crops that depend on scare sources of water for irrigation.
If regulators suddenly declare those sources of water unsafe, the crops that we grow and in turn export will be deemed unsafe in the market. For farmers, that means a dramatic and crippling price spiral. An increase in water prices in California, where much of the United States food crops are grown, will necessarily result in across-the-board food price spikes for the rest of the nation.
California EPAs regulatory moves wont just impact the fine folks of the Golden State, but will bear weight on the pocketbooks of every American in the check-out aisle.
There is no question that very high levels of perchlorate can be harmful. Very high levels are very rarely found. At low levels, as it normally presents, it is not threatening to even at-risk populations. But when we attempt to purge in perpetuity something that nature produces every hour of every day, were talking about massive sums of money  amounts that California simply doesnt have.
All of a sudden, the question of costs associated with these two regulations becomes pretty important to get our arms around  especially since its going to be taxpayers and farmers taking the hit.
Unfortunately, Michigan vs. EPA will probably have little impact on either U.S. EPA or California EPA in this case. U.S. EPA has already decided to regulate and California EPA has proposed making their existing regulation the strictest in the country.
So, just how much will it cost to clean up something that occurs naturally and is basically inert at very low levels?
The scary thing is, we already have a pretty good idea of the cost of these two regulations will be.
California has been regulating perchlorate at six parts per billion (ppb) since 2007. Many water systems have raised water rates by 60-70 percent to help pay for treatment costs associated with the existing regulation. Across California hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to clean to the existing standard. Now that most water systems are below 6ppb, California regulators are attempting to lower the bar yet again.
At the federal level, EPA announced four years ago their intention to regulate perchlorate. Problem is, they cant seem to get the science to support their claim that perchlorate is actually harmful at the levels most commonly found in the environment.
Proving something is actually harmful and conducting a basic cost benefit analysis beforethe decision to regulate is at the heart of what the high court held in Michigan vs. EPA.
The cost of this regulation goes beyond simply calculating what water systems will pay to treat the water we all drink. After the US EPA announced their decision to regulate in 2011, the EPAs Inspector General examined their rationale and issued a rather stinging rebuke.
While treatment costs associated with the regulation would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, the true economic cost of the regulation could run as much as $100 billion dollars.
The regulation will in effect declare the vast majority of our drinking water and agricultural crops as contaminated. The Inspector Generals most damning statement, however, was that the regulation will have no positive impact on the health and welfare of Americans at all.
In too many cases administrative agencies like U.S. EPA and California EPA set in motion regulatory actions that lack scientific rational and bear potentially crippling economic consequences for both taxpayers and consumers. In Michigan vs. EPA, despite the high court smack down of EPA, most of the damage had already been done. But its not too late to force California and U.S. EPA to fully account for the costs of these proposed regulations publicly. While they have made the decision to regulate, some political accountability from state and federal lawmakers would help make the true costs of these regulations known to the public.

The president of one of the nations leading right-leaning think-tanks has a message for conservatives:
If we want to pull the next two billion people out of poverty, we need to be warriors for free enterprise, and shout this from the rooftops. No more of the materialistic nonsense. Talk about saving the poor, and then lets watch ourselves win.
This is a central argument from American Enterprise Institute (AEI) president Arthur Brooks new book The Conservative Heart: How to Build a Fairer, Happier, and More Prosperous America.
In one particularly compelling portion of our in-depth conversation with the optimistic and impassioned Mr. Brooks in connection with The Conservative Heart, we had the opportunity to discuss the inherent morality and miracle of capitalism  a miracle that to date Brooks feels many have failed to appreciate, to the detriment of not only conservatives but the world. When I asked Brooks to expound upon the morality of capitalism, here is what he said:

Yea, this is actually the reason Im a conservative. Im a conservative because poverty is what I care about the most. This is very central to me with my Christian faith, but also  in my secular life as just an ethical individual. I care most about people who have been left behind.
And when I started studying in my twenties  I didnt go to college at the ordinary time, I dropped out of college when I was nineteen  I wound up finishing my college education when I was thirty, which was a great advantage because I was studying without being brainwashed. I was a grown up.

And when I was studying economics, I was shocked to learn that in my quest to figure out what could solve poverty, that poverty, starvation levels of poverty around the world have decreased by eighty percent since I was a child. And in looking for the reason  two billion people by the way have been pulled out of starvation level poverty since I was a kid. I didnt know that. I thought things were worse. Theyre better. Much, much better.
So in trying to figure out how you save the next two billion people, and how you can bring all that progress more to the United States where, the poor  its better to be poor in America than in the Third World  but weve stagnated. And the poor are being left behind. So the progress isnt as good. I started looking at the reasons. Why is it that these people have been pulled out of poverty? And the answer is basically: Globalization, free trade, property rights, the rule of law, and American style free enterprise. And by the way, in places like the Pacific Ocean, the American military, thats kept sea lanes safe for world trade.
For the very first time in human history, it was American conservative ideas of free enterprise and American leadership that pulled billions of people out of poverty. That is the most impressive important humanitarian achievement. It is a great moral good. And its been done by American ideas and we didnt even know it. That was working while we were sleeping.
If we want to pull the next two billion people out of poverty, we need to be warriors for free enterprise, and shout this from the rooftops. No more of the materialistic nonsense. Talk about saving the poor, and then lets watch ourselves win.

PHILADELPHIA (AP)  Pope Francis arrived in the City of Brotherly Love on Saturday for the final leg of his U.S. visit  a festive weekend devoted to celebrating Catholic families  and immediately called for the church to place greater value on women.
The pontiffs plane touched down at the Philadelphia airport after takeoff from New York, bringing him to a city of blocked-off streets, sidewalks lined with portable potties, and checkpoints manned by police, National Guardsmen and border agents.

After speeches to Congress and the United Nations earlier this week aimed at spurring world leaders toward bold action on immigration and the environment, he is expected to focus more heavily on ordinary Catholics during his two days in Philadelphia.
Pope Francis celebrates Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul Saturday, Sept. 26, 2015, in Philadelphia. Francis rode by motorcade to the downtown Cathedral and celebrated a Mass for about 1,600 people. In his homily, he said the future of the Catholic Church in the U.S. requires a much more active role for lay Catholics, especially women.(Tony Gentile/Pool Photo via AP)
Francis rode by motorcade to the downtown Cathedral Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul and celebrated a Mass for about 1,600 people. In his homily, he said the future of the Catholic Church in the U.S. requires a much more active role for lay Catholics, especially women.
It means valuing the immense contribution which women, lay and religious, have made and continue to make to the life of our communities, he said.
Francis has repeatedly said women should have a greater role in church leadership, though he has rejected the idea of ordaining women.
His praise of nuns marked his second such public expression of gratitude in the U.S. after the Vatican under his leadership ended a crackdown on the main umbrella group of American sisters. Nuns in the cathedral appreciated the gesture.
We have felt very strong support from him, said Sister Catherine Darcy of Merion, Pennsylvania, one of about 50 members of the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas at the Mass. We feel he recognizes the contribution that religious (women) make to the church throughout the world.
At the airport, a Catholic high school band played the theme song from the Philadelphia-set movie Rocky upon Francis arrival, and among those greeting him was Richard Bowes, a former Philadelphia police officer wounded in the line of duty. Francis also kissed the forehead of a 10-year-old boy severely disabled with cerebral palsy.
Also on the itinerary for Saturday: a late-afternoon speech on religious freedom and immigration at Independence Hall, where the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The 78-year-old Argentine was scheduled to speak from the lectern Abraham Lincoln used to deliver the Gettysburg Address.
Francis will be the star attraction at the World Meeting of Families, a conference for more than 18,000 people from around the world. The weekend lineup also included a Saturday night vigil and an outdoor Mass Sunday evening for 1 million people on the broad Benjamin Franklin Parkway. It will be the last major event of the popes U.S. visit.
On the first two legs of his six-day U.S. journey, in Washington and New York, Francis was greeted by throngs of cheering, weeping well-wishers hoping for a glance or a touch from the wildly popular spiritual leader, despite unprecedented security.
The Philadelphia visit, which was the original reason for his visit to the U.S., all but paralyzed Center City, with stretches of Broad and Market streets and other routes closed to all but pedestrians and lined with metal crowd-control barricades, massive concrete blocks and tall fences.
That didnt seem to deter his fans.
He has a magnetic personality that not only appeals to Catholics, but to the universal masses. Hes not scripted. Hes relatable. His heart, in itself, you can see that reflected through his message, said Filipina Opena, 46, a Catholic from LaMirada, California, as tour groups and families walked among Philadelphias historic sites ahead of the popes visit. People feel hes sincere and hes genuine.
As he did in New York and Washington, the pontiff will give his attention to both the elite and the disadvantaged, this time visiting inmates in Philadelphias largest jail.
Its probably not politicians who will remember his message but the kids, said Liza Stephens, 48, of Sacramento, California, who was in Philadelphia with her two daughters, ages 10 and 12. The three volunteered their time bagging food for Africa, among other activities at the family conference.
The Archdiocese of Philadelphia organized the conference, hoping for a badly needed infusion of enthusiasm amid shrinking membership, financial troubles and one of the worst clergy sex-abuse scandals to hit a U.S. diocese.
The archdiocese has been the target of repeated investigations. In 2011, before Archbishop Charles Chaput came to Philadelphia, a grand jury accused the diocese of keeping on assignment more than three dozen priests facing serious abuse accusations.
A monsignor who oversaw priest assignments was found guilty of child endangerment, becoming the first American church official convicted of a crime for failing to stop abusers.
Cardinal Justin Rigali, who retired as Philadelphia archbishop in 2011 amid the scandal, helped celebrate Saturdays Mass with Francis.
The pope is widely expected to talk privately with abuse victims this weekend.
The visit is also shaping up as one of the most interesting ecclesial pairings of the popes trip. His host is Chaput, an outspoken opponent of abortion and gay marriage who takes an especially hard line.
Francis has strongly upheld church teaching on such issues but has struck a more compassionate note, saying, Who am I to judge? when asked about a supposedly gay priest.
Under Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, many U.S. bishops worked to shore up their authority, upsetting parishioners who had high expectations for more of a say in Catholic life after the modernizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council
By paying tribute to the laity in his homily Saturday, Francis seemed intent on healing one of the major rifts in American Catholicism that has alienated many from the church.
Mary McGuiness, a religion professor at La Salle University, a Catholic school in Philadelphia, said she doesnt anticipate a flood of local Catholics returning to Sunday Mass because of the popes visit. She said the archdiocese has been through too much with abuse scandals and parish closings.
She said the intense attention to his speeches here could inspire people to begin to think more about what Catholicism really means.
I hope that will happen, she said. But I hear a lot of people say, I like this pope, but Im not going back.



Here at TheBlaze Books we enjoy a good political thriller as much as anyone, and frequently more than the political theater created by our real-life representatives.
Along those lines, one of our colleagues tipped us off to a new book we are currently digging through that may be of interest titled What Makes It Worthy, a new novel from political journalist David Paul Kuhn.

Kuhn, a seasoned political veteran who has written for practically every major media institution from The Wall Street Journal to CBSNews.com, covering four presidential campaigns and countless other beats, has written a novel that has both a human interest angle as well as House of Cards-like intrigue.
Check out a Blaze exclusive excerpt from the book below:

Many members of Congress are calling for an end to government funding for Americas biggest abortion mill, Planned Parenthood. Americans were outraged over the organizations alleged sale of aborted-baby parts as revealed in undercover videos conducted by the Center for Medical Progress.
But the money does not go just one waymembers and employees of Planned Parenthood, as well as the groups PAC, have been very active and generous in their donations to government officials who both funnel taxpayer money to the organization as well as ardently defend abortion.
Considering the Democratic Partys official pro-choice stance, it comes as no surprise that Planned Parenthoods donations would skew toward the Democrats. For example, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, during the 2014 election cycle, PP gave $892,000 to Democrats and $3,100 to Republicans. The 2012 election cycle was even more generous to the Democrats, with $1.2 million to Dems compared to $26,600 to GOPers.
After adding up the annual individual candidate numbers from the Center for Responsive Politics, here are the 25 federal politicians who have received the most Planned Parenthood campaign cash from 1990 (the first year for which data was available) through the end of August:

The 2012 election cycle was even more generous to the Democrats, with $1.2 million to Dems compared to $26,600 to GOPers.
After adding up the annual individual candidate numbers from the Center for Responsive Politics, here are the 25 federal politicians who have received the most Planned Parenthood campaign cash from 1990 (the first year for which data was available) through the end of August:




If it sounds too good to be true, its probably a scam.
Thats what one popular grocery store chain is now warning after coupons to the store started circulating on social media. $100 off your next purchase of $120 or more, it reads. But according to the grocery stores own Facebook page, the so-called coupon isnt what it seems.
This is not supported by Publix and this coupon is not valid at any of our locations. We recommend not participating in the promotion or providing your personal information. Thank you for your patience as we investigate this situation, a Facebook post from the company reads.





There is a fraudulent Publix coupon circulating on social media that states "$100 off your purchase of $120 or more".
Posted by Publix onSunday, July 12, 2015


The scam appears to be similar to another grocery store scam that popped up on social media just last week. That one was targeting Aldi customers and, much like this latest one, relied on Facebook users sharing the link and entering their personal information to obtain their free coupon.
Its unclear whether the link to the Publix scam contains any malicious code that could infect your computer and somehow compromise your data, but as WFTS-TV reported, the best way to avoid any issues is to simply avoid clicking the link altogether.

A video of a big sister and little brother duet is going viral, being called by some a mind-blowing rendition of David Guetta and Sias song Titanium.
Leah Kirwan from Ireland posted the video of her and Noah, who has Down syndrome, singing the song on Facebook Saturday, where it has since garnered more than 632,000 views as of the time of this posting.

The National Labor Relations Board issued a ruling Thursday that could have sweeping effects on the relationships of large corporations such as McDonalds to employees of the individual franchises across the country.
The NLRBs Democratic majority voted 3-2 to redefine joint employer with a standard that could hold a corporation liable for labor law violations by subcontractors, while also requiring the corporations to negotiate with unions seeking to organize for the subcontractor or franchisee.

In 2013, theTeamsters union soughtto represent employees of a Browning-Ferris recycling facility in California. The workers were employed by a subcontractor, Leadpoint Business Services. An NLRB regional director determined that Browning-Ferris and Leadpoint were not joint employers.
However, the decision by the full NLRB determined the two were joint employers, thus making Browning-Ferris responsible for the employees. This has wide-ranging impact on other companies byrolling back decades of common business practice to assert that a franchise is responsible for direct and immediate control over workers, the Chicago Tribune reported.
The ruling could have considerable impact on chains like McDonalds and others, according to Forbes, citing Jania Bailey, a board member of the International Franchising Association and chief executive of consulting firm FranNet.
If this goes into effect then the franchiser has to step in and have a standard for hiring, human resources, payroll, everything, Baily said. It basically nullifies this independent business model.
The standard established by the decision is whether a company couldpotentiallyexert control over a workers wages and working conditions, according to Forbes. Thispotential control could be based on one companys economic power over a contractor, which unions argued to the NLRB limits the contractors ability to raise wages. The decision also took into consideration modern technology that allows corporate franchisers to monitor productivity of employees at a franchise.
The two Republicans on the board issued a scathing 28-page dissent, saying the Democratic majority ignored clear term of existing law that exempts companies using contractors from the definition of employer.


Donald Trump was met with boos from the conservative audience at the 2015 Values Voter Summit on Friday after he called Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) a clown during his speech.
C-SPAN screengrab/TPM
Trump didnt get very far into his sentence before the boos started flying.
You have this clown, Marco Rubio, Trump said to strong boos. Ive been so nice to him.
Hes in favor of immigration, he has been, Trump added, criticizing Rubio for being in the Gang of Eight.
Politico has more on Trumps attack on Rubio before he even hit the stage:
Even before he took the stage, Trump was swinging at Rubio. The billionaire businessman was weaving his way through the hallways at the event, but he came to a full stop when asked about Rubio.
I mean the guy doesnt show up. Hes got the worst record in the entire United States Senate. And hes obviously not a very hard worker, Trump said in the hallways of the event, adding, You know, when you get elected as a senator you have to show up and you have to be there and you have to vote and Rubio doesnt vote.
Rubio spoke a short time before his fellow GOP presidential candidate bashed him on the stage. Rubio caused the crowd to erupt in thunderous cheers and applause when he accounted that House Speaker John Boehner was resigning from Congress.

A British man is in hot water with his wife after she found him doing something he wasnt supposed to in a Google Street View image.
Donny Rydingfrom Liverpool, England, had apparently denied accusations made by his wife that he was still smoking.
Hed been told to give up smoking and to stop eating unhealthy foods after he had a heart attack, Rydingswife,Julie, told the Liverpool Echo. I cleaned his car out for him and I found loads of Hobnob biscuits in there. I confronted him and he denied it and he wouldnt admit to it.
He stormed out of the house and then later that day wed heard that the Street View camera was driving around, she said.
Julie Rydingtook to the Internet and sure enough, she claims to have found the image of her husband outside smoking a cigarette.

When I checked it online I couldnt believe it  there was no denying it now wed seen it, Julie Rydingtold the newspaper.
To be fair, it is difficult to see if he is in fact holding a cigarette.
You cant even lie to your wife anymore, an anchor for Chicagos WGN-TV joked in a report about the image:

The Liverpool Echo reported that the street view image online has been replaced with one that no longer features the husband, but noted that the old one is still available in past photos on the site.We, however, could not find the original image without more information on exactly where he lives in the city.

A Michigan man was on abe-on-the-lookout alert issued by Ann Arbor police early Thursday.
Later that morning, a 19-year-old man matching his description was sitting on the edge of a strip malls roof  his feet dangling off it  in Pittsfield Township,MLive reported, just a few miles south of Ann Arbor.
Image source: WXYZ-TV
I think it was crazy,Ashley Parker, store manager of the malls Dollar General, told WXYZ-TV.Idont know how in the heck he got up there.
The man was threatening to jump, the station added.
But Pittsfield Township Police officer Jack Pattwell was soon communicating with the man, who agreed to let him come up to the roof,MLive said.
Patwell and another officer,Mike McVicker, got to the roof using a fire department ladderbut then the man began moving closer to the roofs edge, MLive said.
Some cellphone images appear to show the man not sitting but standing as an officer moved in behind him.

Raising the minimum wage has been a hot topic among Democrats this year. So we wondered: if America has a minimum wage, do some also think the U.S. needs a cap on how much money an individual can earn?
We polled people in New York and Virginia on the subject. Watch the results of our survey.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told his employees that if there were any truth to the New York Times scathing expose that painted the company as having a cruel and near-impossible work environment, he would quit his job.
Bezos blasted theTimesfor going beyond reporting on rare and isolated instances of callous management practices  which even then, he said, should not be tolerated  by then depicting the company as creating a soulless work environment.

The Times report, published Saturday, told anecdotes of several current and former employees who said they pulled multiple all-nighters in a row, cried frequently at their desks and were unable to work with managers when faced serious illnesses or deaths of loved ones.
[The New York Times] claims that our intentional approach is to create a soulless, dystopian workplace where no fun is had and no laughter heard, Bezos wrote to his employees in the email,obtained by MarketWatch. Again, I dont recognize this Amazon and I very much hope you dont, either. More broadly, I dont think any company adopting the approach portrayed could survive, much less thrive, in todays highly competitive tech hiring market.

Bezos went on to compliment his employees, saying Amazon only hires the best and the brightest workers who could have jobs anywhere else that they wanted.
I strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay. I know I would leave such a company, he said.
Bezos encouraged employees to report instances of abuse or mismanagement to Amazons human resources department or email him directly. The CEO also encouraged employees to read the New York Times piece as well as a counterpiece posted to LinkedIn by a current employee.
Read the full email below:
Dear Amazonians,
If you havent already, I encourage you to give this (very long) New York Times article a careful read:
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html
I also encourage you to read this very different take by a current Amazonian:
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amazonians-response-inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-nick-ciubotariu
Heres why Im writing you. The NYT article prominently features anecdotes describing shockingly callous management practices, including people being treated without empathy while enduring family tragedies and serious health problems. The article doesnt describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day. But if you know of any stories like those reported, I want you to escalate to HR. You can also email me directly at jeff@amazon.com. Even if its rare or isolated, our tolerance for any such lack of empathy needs to be zero.
The article goes further than reporting isolated anecdotes. It claims that our intentional approach is to create a soulless, dystopian workplace where no fun is had and no laughter heard. Again, I dont recognize this Amazon and I very much hope you dont, either. More broadly, I dont think any company adopting the approach portrayed could survive, much less thrive, in todays highly competitive tech hiring market. The people we hire here are the best of the best. You are recruited every day by other world-class companies, and you can work anywhere you want.
I strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay. I know I would leave such a company.
But hopefully, you dont recognize the company described. Hopefully, youre having fun working with a bunch of brilliant teammates, helping invent the future, and laughing along the way.
Thank you,
Jeff


Charlotte, North Carolinas $37 million streetcar officially began moving this week, and those in the community were still wondering  was it worth that much money?
Knowing the backlash that the electric streetcar has received in the community, two editors at CharlotteFive, a new project of the Charlotte Observer that says it delivers both news and entertainment to Millennials, decided to see just how efficient the streetcar is and challenged it to a race.
Image source: YouTube
According to a video produced by the online site, Charlottes Gold Line streetcar travels at a speed of approximately 16 mph and only makes six stops on its 1.5 mile route, during which it abides by traffic laws such as stoplights. But when pitted against Katie Toussaint, an assistant editor at CharlotteFive, on its opening day, the Gold Line streetcars achievements didnt shine quite so bright.
The streetcar completed its route in 11 minutes and 32 seconds, according to CharlotteFive.
Toussaint, 25, completed the same route in 9 minutes and 31 seconds  almost exactly two minutes faster.
VIDEO
We thought it would be funny because it seems kind of ridiculous to get out and chase a moving vehicle throughout Charlotte, Toussaint told TheBlaze in an interview.
The video claims that Toussaint, who told TheBlaze she completed a half-marathon in November, prepared for the race against the machine by drinking sangria and eating chocolate the night before as well as stretching.
Since CharlotteFive released its video Tuesday, Toussaint said other people have taken the challenge and raced the streetcar, which is free for passengers to ride. One person, she said, even beat her time.
The Charlotte Observer reported that the Gold Line was Charlottes first streetcar in 77 years. A pet project of U.S. Secretary of Transportation and former Charlotte mayor, Anthony Foxx was on hand to praise the new mode of transportation at its ribbon-cutting ceremony Tuesday.
While speaking of the new streetcar, Foxx alluded to recent tragedies across the country  such as the mass shooting in Charleston and unrest in Baltimore and Ferguson  and claimed the nation needs more action-based dialogue and projects that can improve peoples lives, according to the Observer.
According to the Charlotte Business Journal, $25 million of the streetcars cost was paid for by a federal grant. The remaining $12 million cost was paid for by city taxpayers.

Even though Apple only has its iPhone and iPad users best interests at heart, its move to strengthen phone security by requiring a six-digit password, as opposed to just four, is not welcome by everyone.
Photo credit: Shutterstock

This new unlocking requirement on iOS9 was announced at Apples annual software conference Monday.
The passcodes you use on your Touch IDenabled iPhone and iPad will now have six digits instead of four, Apples website stated. If you use Touch ID, its a change youll hardly notice. But with one million possible combinations  instead of 10,000  your passcode will be a lot tougher to crack.
That extra second it will take to tap two more numbers is not sitting well with some. Heres some of the reaction on Twitter:
IOS 9 SEEMS COOL BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO MAKE A 6-DIGIT PASSCODE
 jaz (@StaircaseDream) June 9, 2015

6 DIGIT PASSCODES NOW?!
 THANK YOU HARRY !! (@latersbabyhes) June 8, 2015

Ok Apple I disagree with the 6 digit passcode. My lunch number is only 4.
 Allie (@Sarah_Pinson) June 8, 2015

Some haveexplained that this change might even be a move to help crack down on people making double duty out of their bank card PINs, which are also four digits.
Hanni Fakhoury, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, however, told Ars Technica that with cellphone thefton the rise, more digits to enhance a security code is a good practice.
If this will deter violent crimes like robbery and secure information, than Im all for it, Fakhoury said. Plus, while it may make it more difficult for law enforcement, it wont make it impossible and they will still have lots of techniques at their disposal to get access to information on devices.
Other announcements at the annual conference included a$10-a-month music service is called Apple Music, which combines on-demand listening, a 24/7 radio station hosted by live DJs and a forum for artists to give fans behind-the-scenes content from upcoming releases.

The service will be launched later this month in more than 100 countries. It comes at a time when iTunes songs and album sales are falling, while streaming music leaders like Spotify and Deezer are gaining subscribers and revenue.
The music service was the biggest news of the companys five-day conference, but Apple also announced a host of new upgrades and services coming later this year to the operating software for its popular iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.

The new features including enhancements to Siri, the companys voice-activated digital assistant, as well as Apple Pay, Apple Maps and the Apple Watch. Executives also mentioned a new streaming TV service that Apple is reportedly hoping to announce later this year.
Analysts say the new services and upgrades, which will be available when Apple releases free updates to its iOS and Mac OS software this fall, are part of a broader strategy to make Apples devices indispensable.
While many companies make smartphones and computers, Apples crown jewels are its software and online services, said analyst Daniel Ives, who follows tech companies for FBR Capital Markets.
Some of the new features could provide new profits for the tech powerhouse. But perhaps more importantly, they may help keep customers from defecting to rivals like Google, which showed off new features for its competing Android mobile software at its event last month.

Students at two Massachusetts high schools are upset over the schools latest ban  hoodies.
According to WBZ-TV, a principal at South High Community School in Worcester decided to implement the ban on the popular sweatshirts due to concerns from local law enforcement of gang violence. The sweatshirts hoods and large front pockets can be a security concern as they can conceal a persons face and weapons, Principal Maureen Binienda said.

I have to be able to see who is in my building, I have to identify them, Binienda told WBZ.

Im just convinced if you dont wear that hooded sweatshirts during school, it will make our community safer, Binienda, who had been considering the ban for a few years, said.
Besides security concerns, students also can hide headphones in their hoods during class time.
However, students at South High and Burncoat High School  the other Worcester, Massachusetts school public school with a newly implemented hoodie ban  arent too thrilled about having to leave their sweatshirts in their lockers.
I think its honestly bizarre. Its kind of ridiculous, Jazlyn Borrero, a Burncoat senior, told the Telegram & Gazette. They announced it the first day, and everyone was shocked. Seventy-five percent of the school wears hoodies every day.
The Telegram reported that students at both schools have started a petition to override the ban.
Javonn Daley, a Burncoat junior, said some students have been defying the ban and simply tucking in their hoods.
School committee members have also expressed concern about the new policy as it was implemented so close to the start of school with little warning and many of the students had already done their back to school shopping.
I cant afford it, but they wont let my son inside with the hoodie, Diana Ortiz told WBZ.
According to WBZ, students who show up wearing a hoodie will be given a traditional school sweatshirt to wear during the duration of the school day if needed. South Highs student band is also selling sweatshirts sans hoods or pockets.

Paul Houle started feeling back and chest pain last week during and well after football practice. What the 17-year-old high school senior did next, might have saved his life: he checked his pulse.
Houle didnt have to press down on his wrist the old-fashioned way to figure out his heart was going at 145 beats per minute two hours after practice ended though. According to WBZ-TV, the Cape Cod, Massachusetts, teenager three days earlier had purchased an Apple Watch and that made getting this health information even easier.
Paul Houle only had his Apple Watch for three days but when he saw that his heart rate was 145 beats per minute two hours after football practice, well above his resting average, he knew something was wrong. (Images source: WCVB-TV)
With the average resting heart rate of an adult being 60 to 100 beats per minute, the news station reported that Houle contacted the team trainer and was rushed to the hospital where he learned he hadrhabdomyolysis, a condition characterized by the breakdown of muscle tissue that leads to the release of muscle fiber contents into the blood, according to the National Institutes of Health. This could lead to kidney damage or failure if not treated. WCVB-TV reported that the teen hadheart, liver and kidney failure by the time he was admitted to the hospital.
A variety of things could causerhabdomyolysis, but in Houles case, it was likely dehydration from not one but two practices during a hot day that week.
I was so dehydrated that my muscles started to actually break down and release a protein that is sort of toxic into my blood stream which caused my heart, my liver and my kidneys all to shut down, Houle told WBZ.
While Houle said hes happy to be alive, he also has something else to be pleased about, despite having to miss some of the Tabor Academyfootball season in recovery.
Paul Houle told the local media he is just happy to be alive, but Apple CEO Tim Cook offered the teen a summer internship as well. (Images source: WCVB-TV)
The news station reported that the teen received a call from Apple CEO Tim Cook who offered him an internship next summer.
Houle credits Apple Watch with saving his life.
If my Apple Watch hadnt shown me it was 145, I would have done nothing about it, he told WCVB.

One of the cool things about being bilingual is that I get access to an entire gamut of information that most people dont ever get to hear.
From things like radio commercials in Spanish during the 2012 election season declaring that the GOP would deport ALL immigrants, to Marco Rubios softer stance on the presidents Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program during a Spanish-only interview with Jorge Ramos  speaking Spanish in todays political climate is kind of like having access to an alternative universe of sorts.

And sometimes its really disturbing.

Take Emilio Estefans latest star-studded production, We Are All Mexicans for example, where we who argue that illegal immigration is wrong are told not to kill the American dream for the millions of people (Mexican and otherwise) who want to come here by whatever means possible.
Estefans song continues: le damos mamey (f*** em) to those who no nos quiera (dont want us here); that the immigrants are triunfando (winning), and hearts in the sky for the red, white and green.
In other words, I love what I can obtain by living in this country, but I have zero interest in actually becoming a real PART of this country. Oh, and screw you for daring to suggest Im doing anything wrong.
Seriously, stop and think about that.
Theyre not pleading; theyre not begging for asylum like the Syrian and Iraqi Christians who are being raped, beheaded and sold into slavery on the daily  theyre DEMANDING that immigrants, regardless of HOW they came, be welcomed with open arms.
For so many people, the debate just ends there. We dont want to be accused of racism; of bigotry; of intolerance. After all, if Emilio Estefan can get some of the biggest names in the Latino AND American entertainment industries to come out and throw a big f*** you (literally) to everyone who disagrees, no wonder its hard to get people (especially politicians) to take a stand.
And so for so many, the debate just ends right there.
Truly, the whole thing has become a cacophony of peripheral arguments, accusations and excusesand were being royally coerced into letting it all slide.

And you know what? Im tired of it.
Im tired of how lawlessness has become a human rightso long as its in pursuit of what youve always dreamed of.
Im tired of having my homeland demanded from mejust because the rest of the world doesnt think its fair.
Im tired of being called a [insert pejorative here] for expecting people to follow the same rules my husband did.
On that note, Im tired of feeling like I have to add some kind of personal justification or qualifier to my opinions (i.e. I can talk this way because my husbands an immigrant/my daughters half Mexican/Ive lived in Mexico) every time I voice something thats politically incorrect. Right is right, and wrong is wrong. I shouldnt need a qualifier.
Im tired of being told to pity immigrants who are forced to live in the shadows because of their statuswhen in reality that was their choice. Does anyone stop and think about that? That, just like anyone who speeds and gets a ticket, or steals and goes to jail, there are consequences for crossing the border illegally?
Im tired of a watching outspoken Latino figures like Carlos Vives and Eugenio Derbez do nothing to fix the violence and corruption in their countries of origin, while they criticize the United States time and again for not wanting to bend to their whim. Where is this same passion when it comes to spreading the principles that made this country so uniquely free and prosperous?
I just said Im sick of qualifiersbut Im going to add one after all: Believe me when I say I want everyoneEVERYONE to be able to experience the blessed freedom under which Ive had the privilege of growing up.
But, as I pointed out a few weeks ago, wanting something doesnt make it a right.
Heres the deal. The United States is already by far the largest destination for immigrants, with more than 45.7 million living in the country.
In other words, were not exactly shutting all the doors.
And yet were called selfish, bigoted, racist and otherwise mean for suggesting that there be a process (in need of repair though it may be) to come and enjoy the freedoms others bought and paid for.
Were admonished by the leader of the Catholic Church that unless we let these people in without question, were basically not being Christ-like; were not following the Golden Rule.
The problem is not that we are not letting people in. The problem is that we aredespite a blatant disregard for our laws.
Yes, we can the follow the Golden Rule; we can share our blessings with others. But to do it we shouldnt have to throw out the law. After all, doesnt lawlessness rather negate the Christ-like component the Pope was advocating?
Were the proverbial shining city on a hill for a reason. And the next time someone comes at me with the its not fair; we should be nicer argument, I plan to remind them: every time the law is flagrantly broken; every time the law is spit upon and we sit back and cheerwe chip away at the very essence of what makes us so astoundingly free in a world of tyranny.
And that essenceisnt that what so many are ultimately coming here to find?

As Amazon works to purge its online shopping site of all things Confederate flag, it seems a nonfiction historical book has gotten caught in the crossfire.
Michael Dreese is a Pennsylvanian author who writes nonfiction, historical books predicated on the Battle of Gettysburg. Among his books include one about the Union battle flag and one about the Confederate battle flag, the latter of which seems to have been deemed inappropriate by Amazon.

Image source: WNEP-TV
According to Dreese, he recently received an email from Amazon that informed him that one of his products violated the restrictions the company had placed on Confederate flag merchandise. That product, he said, is his book, This Flag Never Goes Down!: 40 Stories ofConfederate Battle Flags and Color Bearers at the Battle of Gettysburg, published in 2004.
Amazon has implemented listing restrictions for Confederate flag merchandise, the email obtained by TheBlaze stated. You may no longer list these products on Amazon.com, and your listings for these products will be removed. There is no adverse impact on your seller account for the removal, but we request that you refrain from relisting removed products.
The email goes on to promise that Amazon will reimburse any of the FBA Return Fee or FBA Disposal Fee costs as long as Dreeses product is effectively removed by Aug., 22. After that date, Dreese would be charged removal and disposal fees without a reimbursement, or the company could simply remove the book itself, according to the email.
If you do not submit a Removal Order for affected inventory by August 22, 2015, we may dispose of this unsellable inventory in accordance with the Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement, the email sent on June 26 read.
Dreese stressed to TheBlaze that his book is a historical nonfiction piece that does not promote the [Confederate] flag, but simply places it in historical context at the Battle of Gettysburg.
When Dreese spoke to local news outletWNEP-TV last week, his book had already been removed from his author page on Amazon, well before the Aug., 22 deadline,. Although his other books were still available for purchase, including his book on the Union battle flag, This Flag Never Goes Down! is only available through a Gettysburg gift shop or the publisher, Thomas Publications, according to WNEP.
Screenshot of Michael Dreeses author page on Amazon.
I was shocked because I knew the book was a work of historical nonfiction, Dreese told TheBlaze. The impact on sales was not a major concern since my writing projects are mainly for enjoyment and education. Income is definitely a secondary consideration.
They were the primary means of communication, Dreese told WNEP of both the Confederate and Union battle flags. The battlefield could be a very smoky, noisy, confusing atmosphere.
However, on Monday, a few copies of the book were still on the marketplace website, just not under Dreeses author page.
Dreese said he hasnt used eBay in the past as a platform to sell his books but that he might explore that option. Like Amazon, eBay also enacted a ban on Confederate flag merchandise from its online site following the June slaying of nine black church members in Charleston, S.C.
I think it sets a dangerous precedent, Dreese told TheBlaze of Amazons removal of his book. We need to examine our history objectively, the good and the bad.
A representative from Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from TheBlaze.

Thirty-two years ago, my mom decided to sit down and write a letter.
In her perfect, elegant schoolteacher script, she wrote to encourage a man she felt needed comforting. She thought that, if the letter ever crossed his desk, it might make a difference to know that someone even way out in rural Minnesota was thinking of him and praying for him as he traversed this most difficult job.

The weeks past. Low and behold, one day a response arrived. It stood out from the other letters and bills in the mailboxit felt thick and hard, as though a piece of cardboard was in the long envelope.
Indeed, between two pieces of cardboard was one simple piece of paper, on which the recipient of my moms letter wrote to thank her for her words of encouragement.
It was signed: Ronald Reagan.
This Dec. 17, 1981 file photo shows President Ronald Reagan pointing to a reporter for the next question during his news conference in the East Room at the White House in Washington. AP Photo, File

Peggy Noonanspecial assistant to the 40th president once recalled how Reagan would take time each day to pour over a selection of a dozen or so letters from the thousands that came daily.
Not only did he read them, but he took time to respond. It was just who he was. He didnt do it for political purposeshe responded because, as Noonan further wrote, Reagan was utterly egalitarian and never thought he was stooping to the people he wrote to
Noonan continued:
He realized that people pour their hearts out to presidents and in a modern, highly technological society with a quarter billion people it was important that they know that they have at least a chance to make it through to the top guy. That is why he answered letters from citizens with the same kind of care and respect that he gave letters from world leaders, from popes and prime ministers. That moment, when you treat the lonely mother like a great leader, is the Great Democratic Moment, the one in your office, alone, that silently expresses who we are. (pp. 259-260, When Character Was King: A Story of Ronald Reagan)
My husband (who, as many of you know, did not grow up here) once asked me: So, I understand the importance of Reagans policiesbut explain to me: why he is revered on SUCH a level today?
Hes rightit seems like Reagan is invoked more often than a candidates own family when theyre out on the campaign trail, and theres nary a conservative gathering, club, or event where his name isnt dropped at least once.
So what IS it?
That certain je ne sai quois of sortsI contendwas exactly how Noonans title describes him: character.
Agree or disagree with his politics, he was a genuinely good manand it was magnetic. The genuineness of his persona set him apart, and I believe its actually a starvation for that realness that has fostered the Donald Trump phenomena of 2015.
Except theres a difference between bold characterand brashness for the heck of it (think Trump, and his take on Rand Paul: I never attacked him or his looks, and believe me, theres plenty of subject matter right there.)
But thats a story for another dayor another writer.
I watched the second GOP President Debateand amid the groan-worthy smack-downs from some, the cringe-worthy boringness of others, and the truly impressive moments from still othersone statement in particular had me shouting at the screen in agreement.
(By the way, after a summer of storms, a wedding, Fourth of July fireworks, and now Mommys very vocal viewing of the debates, Im pretty sure its official: My kid can sleep through anything.)
It was so powerful a statement that I couldnt get it out of my head. And there it sat all evening, and all day the following day, right alongside the aforementioned title of Noonans book:
Iran and Planned Parenthood. One has something to do with the defense of security of this nation. The other has something to do with the defense of the character of this nation.
That was former HP CEO Carly Fiorina, who continued: I dare, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes [in reference to the harvesting of organs from aborted children]. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. This is about the character of our nation

And in just a few seconds, Fiorina brilliantly summed up the potential demise of our nation and our society: the enemy that longs to kill us from without, and the disease thats already killing us from within.
While our national security is incredibly hard to protect (and incredibly hard to get back once you arm the state sponsor of terror with nuclear weapons), a loss of our character is something rotting and infectious.
Americans, especially my liberal friends: we can disagree about economics and foreign policy; we can disagree about immigration and education. We can disagree about a lotand to be certain, many of these things have dire consequences if poorly or wrongly addressed.
We cannot disagree about character.
And thats what we need to recognize as the heart of the rotting problems in our country.
Its a lack of character.
Its a little body prematurely taken from its mothers womb, lying on a table awaiting death at the hands of a soulless adult who cackles about how best to preserve the parts; a soulless adult who wont see the inside of a jail for murder, and who is instead defended for preserving womens healthcare.
Its a group that believes cops are pigs in a blanket to be fried like bacon, and that it should be open season on cops and white peopleand who are then greeted at the White House.
Its Middle Eastern Christians whose children are being crucified, whose women are being sold into sex slavery, and whose men are being beheaded, and who are subsequently offered no help from a government that instead vowed to help 10,000+ Syrian refugees; one out of every 50 of whom are believed to be Islamic State fighters.
Its a presidental candidate who makes jokes about putting our national security at risk by using a private server for State Department email conversations.
I dont know whether or not Carly Fiorina will, or should win the GOP nomination for the presidency. But I know one thing for certain: if the pinnacle of her campaign was her comment in last Wednesday nights debate, her efforts have been well worth it.
You see, shes done us a great service by reminding us that no matter WHO we choose, were choosing a warrior to fight not just for the economic survival and national security of our country, but for its character; for its very soul.
Think about that when you go to the polls.

A report on a conservative political news website suggesting outgoing Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) cut a deal with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) before his exit is false, a person inside Boehners office with knowledge of the situation told TheBlaze.
In the immediate aftermath of Boehners resignation announcement, Breitbart published a story about a rumor swirling on Capitol Hill that indicated a deal had been struck between the two party leaders to continue funding some of President Barack Obamas most controversial measures.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has clashed with Boehner in the past, added fuel to the fire by repeating the rumor while at the conservative Values Voter Summit.
I will say, the early reports are discouraging. If it is correct that the speaker, before he resigns, has cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of its tenure, to fund Obamacare, to fund executive amnesty, to fund Planned Parenthood, to fund implementation of this Iran deal  and then, presumably, to land in a cushy K Street job after joining with the Democrats to implement all of President Obamas priorities, that is not the behavior one would expect of a Republican speaker of the House, Cruz said.
Asked if the report were true, a Boehner aide who spoke to TheBlaze on the condition of anonymity said, Not at all, as is typical of [Breitbart.]
The aide said that the Senate has demonstrated it cannot pass defunding of Planned Parenthood and will pass a clean continuing resolution that will be brought to the House and passed with bipartisan support.
House GOP will pursue the budget reconciliation process to defund Planned Parenthood and break Senate Dems logjam, the aide said. This is the strategy that will actually advance the pro-life movement, as National Right to Life has articulated.
The Boehner aide also took some shots at Breitbart and one of its star reporters, Matthew Boyle. Breitbart and Boyle are known to publish inflammatory stories highly critical of anyone that doesnt toe the hardline-conservative view.
I have nothing against Daniel Webster, but it is hilarious to me that Breitbart is trumpeting the fact that he is running for speaker, the aide told TheBlaze, referring to Florida Congressman Daniel Webster. Webster has endorsed Jeb Bush.
I can see the Boyle headline now, the person continued. EXCLUSIVE: BREITBART.COM PUSHES JEB SUPPORTER FOR SPEAKER.
Boehner is set to resign from Congress at the end of next month.

PHILADELPHIA (TheBlaze/AP)  Within an hour of the start of a festival headlined by Pope Francis, Mark Wahlberg already had made a joke about his raunchy movie Ted.
The actor was the master of ceremonies Saturday night while Francis sat on stage to hear from families and musical performances at the World Meeting of Families event.

After Bobby Hill, 14, of the Keystone State Boychoir performed an opera solo, he told Wahlberg that he liked his performance in the movie about an angry talking teddy bear.
He whispered in my ear that he loved the movie Ted, Wahlberg said before adding the joke. And I told him that was not appropriate for a boy of his age. Holy Father, please forgive me. Ive always hoped that the good Lord has a sense of humor when comes and pertains to many of the movies Ive made.
The Boston-born actor, who also played Vince Papale in Invincible, a film about a real-life walk-on who signed with the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1970s, also offered a Go Eagles! after introducing Herb Lusk, regarded as the first player to take a knee and pray after a touchdown. Lusk left the Eagles for the ministry and is senior pastor at the Greater Exodus Baptist Church in Philadelphia.

When Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was asked Saturday if hes one of those who doesnt believe Barack Obama is a Christian, the GOP presidential candidate said he wouldnt speculate on Obamas spirituality.
The presidents faith is between him and God, Cruz told reporters in Des Moines, Iowa, the Huffington Post reported.

But Cruz did comment about Obamas policies, which he said have been profoundly damaging to this country.
His policies and this administrations animosity to religious liberty and, in fact, antagonism to Christians, has been one of the most troubling aspects of the Obama administration, Cruz said. We have seen a war on faith.

WASHINGTON  Hours after House Speaker John Boehner announced that he would be resigning from Congress, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz added fuel to the fire by saying hedheard early reports that Boehner cut a dealwith Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to continue funding some of President Barack Obamas most controversial measures.
I will say, the early reports are discouraging. If it is correct that the speaker, before he resigns, has cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of its tenure, to fund Obamacare, to fund executive amnesty, to fund Planned Parenthood, to fund implementation of this Iran deal  and then, presumably, to land in a cushy K Street job after joining with the Democrats to implement all of President Obamas priorities, that is not the behavior one would expect of a Republican speaker of the House, Cruz told reporters at the conservative Values Voter Summit in Washington.

The unconfirmed report came from conservative news site Breitbart. The speakers office did not immediately respond to an inquiry from TheBlaze about Cruzs charge.

Addressing activists at the summit gathering, the Republican presidential candidate told the crowd that they scare the Washington establishment.
You want to know how much each of you terrifies Washington? Yesterday, John Boehner was speaker of the House, Cruz said. You come to town and somehow that changes. My only request is, can you come more often?
The comment prompted huge applause from the conservative audience.
Also during his speech, Cruz vowed that if elected president, Iran would not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons  and threatened that we may have to introduce Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khameneito the 72 virgins.
If you vote for Hillary, you are voting for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, Cruz said. If you vote for me, under no circumstances will a theocratic country led by an ayatollah that chats death to America, will Iran be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. And if the ayatollah doesnt understand that, we may have to introduce him to the 72 virgins.
Cruz laid out an ambitious agenda for his first day in office that included ripping to shreds the Iranian nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration, along with Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. The deal with Iran allows continued uranium enrichment but not for weapons. Several polls have show that a majority the public makes the country less safe.
Do you know which campaign raised the most hard money? We did, Cruz told the audience.
Cruz has seen his polling improve since the first two GOP presidential debates, though he is still well behind the top tier candidates such as Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina. Cruz has won the 2013 and 2014 Values Voter Summit straw poll.
Cruz had several one-liners during his address. Referring to Hillary Clintons private email server, under investigation by the FBI, Cruz said maybe well se the first Democratic presidential debate in Leavenworth.
Of Fridays meeting between Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Cruz said, Millions of reporters are reporting today on the meeting between the worlds most powerful communist and the president of China.


Gary Brausen was absolutely stunned when he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He was never a smoker, always ate well and had been an active hockey player for decades, but none of that protected him from the pain, uncertainty and surprise that came along with the illness.
Suddenly, his vibrant and seemingly boundless life was rocked by the news that he would have only one or two years left on this Earth. It was a revelation that he said left him devastated  but it was prayer that he and his wife Roseycredit for his eventual healing.

[I was] devastated, especially when the doctors are saying  and we had two second opinions  that this case is terminal, GaryBrausen told The Church Boys podcast. And saying things like, Do you have your affairs in order? Do you have a will? Have you taken a recent family picture, because this is the best youre going to look.
Its an experience that his wife recounted in her new book, Praying for Healing While Planning a Funeral, as she detailed how her husbands diagnosis and healing rocked her world, led the family to rely more than ever on prayer, and surprised doctors.
Listen to Gary and Rosey describe their story below:

Even though I know my Lord so intimately and have a deep relationship with him, I really shook in my boots, Rosey Brausen said, explaining how difficult it was to continue praying when doctors were asking how her husband was going to spend his last days.
She said that God warned the couple that they were in for a battle, and so they hunkered down, refusing to give up hope that healing could be a possibility; rather than give up, they began taking a number of steps in an effort to steadfastly hope  and pray  for the best.
Getting a prayer team around us, saying scripture out loud over us  and then keeping my eyes focused on [God], Rosey said of their actions, which also included treatments and the removal of a lung.
Many times, she said that Christians treat God like a Santa Claus of sorts, imploring him to give us what were praying for, but not realizing that it can sometimes be a long battle  and that he wont always answer every prayer.
In the end, Rosey said that she had to learn true and profound trust in the Almighty as she journeyed through her husbands illness.
If we were going to battle and Gary was still going to go home, [I knew] that [God] would still be sovereign in my life, she said. I dont think we talk about that enough on how long sometimes you have to stay in the game with the Lord as he processes healing through your body.
The couple continued praying and, in August 2014, doctors gave Gary an all-clear, letting him know that he had fully healed. It was a moment that stunned medical professionals, but its one that the couple credits fully to their faith in God.
I would say they were very surprised. Ill never forget the expression on my primary oncologists face when I went back for my first three-month checkup in February of 2012, Gary explained. They were fully expecting the cancer to be all over the place  he was very surprised that it came back clear, and then we had a series of check every six months until February of 2015.
Watch the couple further discuss their journey below:
VIDEO
In the beginning, Gary said that his primary doctor was continuously shocked by what he observed, but that he eventually came to terms with the fact that his patient  a man who had been given just one to two years  was healing.
Rosey said that the situation has shown her that Gods grace is sufficient and that he can be trusted, whether that means that someone is healed this side of heaven of the next. And Gary, too, learned a profound lesson.
You cant necessarily  believe what you hear on Earth if youre going through something difficult, he said. I had some of the most talented oncologists in this country tell me that my days were numbered.
Gary continued, Doctors do not determine  what your last day is going to be  remain hopeful and keep your eyes and ears on the Lord.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  Apple staked a new claim to the living room on Wednesday, as the maker of iPhones and other hand-held gadgets unveiled an Internet TV system thats designed as a beachhead for the tech giants broader ambitions to deliver a wide range of information, games, music and video to the home.

CEO Tim Cook and other executives also showed off two new iPhone models, a plus-sized iPad with detachable keyboard and updated software for the Apple Watch during an exhaustive, two-hour event in San Franciscos Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.

Apple is counting on sales of the new iPhones to maintain its position as one of the most profitable, and valuable, companies in the world.
But its the new Apple TV system that some analysts point to as an important step for the company as Cook attempts to build a business that doesnt rely so heavily on the iPhone.
Apple is laying the groundwork for a broader living-room strategy said analyst Ben Bajarin from the research firm Creative Strategies. Apple wants to make the already-important TV screen into an essential hub for communication and entertainment, he said.
Apple says revamped Apple TV will be available in October, start at $149.
 TheBlazeNOW (@TheBlazeNOW) September 9, 2015

TV plays a huge role in our lives and it occupies an important place in our homes, Cook said during his presentation. He added that Apple believes the future of television is apps that deliver streaming video, games and other services.
For now, however, the iPhone is still Apples most important product. Sales of the iconic smartphone contributed more than two-thirds of the Cupertino, California, companys $107 billion in revenue during the first half of 2015.
Apple announced Wednesday that it will sell two new iPhone models, dubbed the 6s and 6s Plus, starting Sept. 25. Theyre roughly the same size and will cost the same as the record-selling 6 and 6 Plus models introduced last year, which will now sell for $100 less.
The new iPhones will have more memory and faster processors, along with a new 12 mega-pixel camera.
Perhaps the most noticeable upgrade, however, is the addition of 3D Touch, a feature that uses added screen sensors to detect the difference between a light tap and extended finger pressure, triggering different menus and functions for apps made by Apple and outside developers.
No matter what you like to do with your phone, 3D Touch makes it better than ever, boasted Apple Senior Vice President Craig Federighi.
Some analysts have questioned how compelling the new features will be. Apple sold more than 183 million iPhones since the last models were introduced in 2014, which is 40 percent more than it sold in the same period a year earlier. But the company may be hard-pressed to show more growth, especially when smartphone sales are slowing worldwide.
Thats one big concern about Apple, that its so dependent on the iPhone, said Jerry Kim, a Columbia University management professor.
Cook, while insisting there is room for iPhone sales to grow, has begun pushing into new product categories. In addition to the Apple Watch, introduced earlier this year, executives spent a large part of Wednesdays event showing off the new Apple TV.
The new TV box is a significant upgrade from older versions the company has sold since 2007. The new device has a more powerful processor and updated software for running Internet apps and games on TVs, along with streaming music and video. It will start at $149 and will be available in late October.

An integral part of Apples system is a hand-held remote that can be controlled with a touch screen and voice commands, allowing users to request information and search for music, movies or TV shows by using Apples electronic personal assistant, Siri.
Apple Inc. isnt alone in its ambitions for the living room. Its entering a market where rivals such as Roku, Amazon and Nvidia already sell voice-activated TV systems at prices ranging from $100 to $250. Google makes a popular streaming video device, the Chromecast, that sells for $35.
Still, even competitors say Apples clout could change the landscape of the living room.
Apples popularity will make more consumers aware of the latest streaming technology, while encouraging developers to build more games and apps for TV screens, said Matt Wuebbling, general manager for Nvidias Shield system.
Apple TV is unlikely to hurt sales for gaming consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation, however. For now, at least, analysts say those consoles still provide hard-core gaming enthusiasts with more elaborate effects and faster processing speeds than whats generally been available over the Internet.

Cook and his top lieutenants on Wednesday also showed off a new iPad Pro with a 13-inch screen, attachable keyboard and a stylus, which the company hopes will help turn around a two-year slump in iPad sales. Earlier full-sized iPads have had 10-inch screens.

While Apple executive Phil Schiller said the bigger screen offers improved viewing for movies, the company is also promoting the device for workers who will use specialized business apps.

In a move that might have been unthinkable a few years ago, Apple even invited an executive from once-bitter rival Microsoft to come on stage and demonstrate his companys Office productivity software on the iPad Pro.



James Piereson, president of the William E. Simon Foundation and senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute think tank has a new book out in which he makes the case that the political, ideological and cultural consensus that has enabled the last seven decades of American growth and prosperity is coming apart at the seams.
Part of his new Shattered Consensus: The Rise and Decline of Americas Postwar Political Order deals with two economic titans whose philosophies animate the two sides that Piereson sees as currently at loggerheads in America: John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek.
We had the chance to conduct an in-depth interviewwith Piereson, during which we asked him to expound upon the impact of these two figures both on the past and present. Here is what he said:

I spend a couple of chapters on Keynes, and a chapter on Hayek. And I dont really attack Keynes in the book  I try to elucidate his ideas, and I try to explain why Keynes ideas probably dont work in the current period for political reasons, not economic reasons.
I got some of my ideas from Keynes frankly. Keynes wrote a book on World War I called The Economic Consquences of the Peace, in which he basically argued that the events of World War I destroyed the 19th century economic order of free markets and limited government. And he said that for a lot of reasons: One, the European economies were wrecked. All the gold in the world  a lot of it  had moved to the United States. The capital that had been accumulated in that period was destroyed. And he felt that the states and governments in the future would have to take [a] much greater role in guiding economic growth and investment than in the past. And he had a lot of reasons for that.

What I suggest is that in a period in which government spends a great deal  and weve had 70 years of it going back to the 30s and 40s, and interest groups have organized around the state to get that money  Keynesian stimulus policies dont work that well because all the money goes to entrenched interests, many of which are trying to block economic growth to begin with.Theyre trying to get tax breaks. It goes to public employee unions who dont want to see any change. And so therefore, in this context, stimulus spending only creates more roadblocks to growth, when what in fact we need to do is break up the interest group system and free up our economy.
Hayek of course attacks all these Keynesian ideas. He didnt think planning was possible. And he thought the Keynesian remedies would simply lead to more inflation. Hes been partly right on that  Im not sure hes been totally vindicated  but what happened in the wake of the financial crisis was that Keynes came back full bore as if he had never been discredited. People thought his theories had been discredited in the 1970s. But Barack Obama came back with stimulus packages and all sorts of things designed to stimulate demand. And it hasnt worked very well.
For a theory that is as influential as Keyness, its got a very mixed record. Japan of course has tried all sorts of Keynesian stimulus remedies  since 1990, has not worked out very well. Great Britain tried them in the 1960s  they failed. Jimmy Carter tried them in the United States in the 1970s  they failed. One could point to the 1960s  Kennedy and Johnson, especially Kennedys tax cut as a success  but of course he did that via tax cut, not by spending. FDRs policies were too experimental and episodic to be chalked up to Keynesian remedies.
But these two things continue to battle  the two political parties represent the different prongs of these two theories. The Democrats want to stimulate growth by more spending; the Republicans by freeing up the economy. And at the end of the day the voters will decide.
Ive stated in the book where I stand. I dont think the Keynesian remedies will work in our circumstance, even though I think well continue to try them.
When pushed based on comments from the likes of the New York Times Paul Krugman to the effect that the federal government has not thrown enough money at stimulus programs to make Keynesianism work in modern-day America, Piereson continued:


        Weve thrown an enormous amount of Keynesian style stimulus at this problem without a great deal to show for it


I think thats absurd  the idea that the United States has followed a policy of austerity is not accurate. We ran up in 08, 09 and 2010, we ran up annual federal deficits of 10 to 15 percent of GDP  a trillion dollars. Thats enormous amounts of stimulus.
The Federal Reserve has been buying up bonds  not only government bonds but bad mortgages and all sorts of things. The balance sheet of the Fed is now up to $4 or $5 trillion  unprecedented amounts. And of course weve had interest rates at basically zero for six or seven years.
So, weve thrown an enormous amount of Keynesian style stimulus at this problem without a great deal to show for it, and this again gets back to the problem. We need to find a way to generate private sector growth. Were gonna run out of Keynesian ammunition pretty soon if we havent run out of it already.
During the interview, which you can listen to in full below, we also had the chance to speak with Piereson about several other topics including:

Though its hundreds of years old, research is giving us some new insight into the The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo and into the creative genius of one of historys most well-known artists.
On the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel within the Vatican with his finger reaching out toward the hand of God, the 16th century Italian artists depiction of Adam is one of the most iconic and well-known works of art of all time.

Image source: Wikimedia
Analysis of this fresco published in the July issue of the journal Clinical Anatomyprovides mathematical evidence that Michelangelo used the golden ratio, which leads the study authors to believe the beauty and harmony recognized in all Michelangelos works may not be based solely on his knowledge of human anatomical proportions, but that the artist also probably knew anatomical structures that conform to the[golden ratio]display greater structural efficiency.
The idea of famous artists employing the golden ratio is not necessarily new, but the study authors wrote their analysis provides the first published evidence that Michelangelos work incorporates this concept. This, the study authors explained, is the proportion of lengths of line segments, where the ratio between the lengths of the longer and shorter lines is equal to that of the ratio between the combined lengths of the two lines and the length of the longer line.
We believe that this discovery will bring a new dimension to the great work of Michelangelo, Dr. Deivis de Campos, one of the study authors, said in a statement.
Museum staff look up at a projection of Michelangelos Creation of Adam at the Michelangelo Drawings: Closer to the Master Exhibition at The British Museum on March 20, 2006 in London, England. (Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images)
The study authors usedImage Pro Plus Software 6.0 to mathematically analyze the artists work, which they noted in the studys abstract is alsospeculated to hide the image of the brain, helping fuel debate over whether the frescoes merely represent the teachings of the Catholic Church at the time or if there are other meanings hidden in the images.
They called their findings astounding and noted that the fingers of God and Adam are also aligned with other images in the Sistine Chapel.
The study authors acknowledge that opinions of their work will certainly vary, but they wrote that they hope their linking the golden ratio to Michelangelos art will lead to further research into historical works that could contribute to more information on the history of anatomy.

The progressive group Democracy for America is rallying its troops to stop President Barack Obama from nominating a corporate lawyer to serve on the Securities and Exchange Commission.
If we wont tolerate a cop whos working with Main Street criminals, why should we put up with potential Security and Exchange Commission leaders whove colluded with the crooks on Wall Street and their industry shill groups to avoid accountability?, said DFA Chairman Jim Dean, the brother of former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean.

After watching Wall Street greed wreck the economy in 2008, the very least the American people expect and deserve are SEC leaders committed to relentlessly rooting out the criminal element on Wall Street, not their next career move, Dean added in a statement.
Obama had reportedly been planning to nominate Keir Gumbs to fill a Democratic seat on the SEC. Gumbs was an SEC staffer for six years and now works for the law firm of Covington & Burling LLP, where former Attorney General Eric Holder recently returned. His work reportedly included providing legal advice to company on dodging scrutiny from shareholder activists.
Politico reported last week that the administration was putting the nomination on hold until August, and would be vetting other potential nominees for the seat being vacated by SEC member Luis Aguilar, whose term expired last month.
In an email to members, DFA campaign manager Karli Wallace Thompson said, Tell President Obama to do the right thing: Drop all potential SEC nominees who are too close to Wall Street, and nominate real regulators who will be tough on the big banks.
Democracy for America grew out of Howard Deans 2004 presidential campaign.
The message went onto further criticize Obama, saying: Unfortunately, SEC chair  and Obama appointee  Mary Jo White has been a disaster. She has slow-walked critical regulations and has recused herself from important deliberations due to her close ties to Wall Street.
The message concludes: Tell President Obama: We cant afford to put another one of the big banks buddies on the SEC. Nominate tough regulators who will stick up for working families now.



A Saudi prince was arrested Wednesday on sexual assault charges at a Southern California mansion.
The Los Angeles Police Department said 28-year-old Majed Abdulaziz Al-Saud, a member of the royal family of Saudi Arabia, tried to force a woman into performing sex acts with him inside a rented $37 million mansion in Beverly Hills. The home is surrounded by an 8-foot wall as part of a gated community, KNBC-TV reported.
Neighbors said they saw a woman bleeding and trying to climb the wall to escape. Residents then led officers to the property around 1:30 p.m. and Al-Saud was arrested.

While some heads of state and members of their families have diplomatic immunity, the LAPD said Al-Saud does not because of his dignitary status in Saudi Arabia and the level of his alleged crime.
The Saudi prince was freed on $300,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 19, where he will face a charge of forced oral copulation, according to the Los Angeles Times. He also faces charges of battery andfalse imprisonment, NBC News reported.
Police said other foreign nationals have stayed at the $37 million mansion in the past several weeks but that up until Wednesday, the biggest incidents neighbors complained of were a couple of noisy parties.

It was not clear the exact relationship Al-Saud has to King Salman of Saudi of Arabia, but NBC News noted that the royal family is made up of as many as 10,000 people, including Salmans extended kin.
Salman was crowned king in January following the death of King Abdullah.

Theres a newsmartphone bug affecting 95 percent  up to 950 million  Android devices. The worst part, according to the security researcher that exposed the vulnerability, is you dont have to do or click on anything to potentially have your system hacked.

You just have to receive one text message.
Joshua Drake with the mobile security firmZimperium zLabs discovered the vulnerability he calls Stagefright, which he will be presenting at the Black Hat security conference next week. He saidif the Heartbleed flaw (remember Heartbleed, which exposed bank data, emails and other private info through a flaw in Internet server coding) sends chill down your spine, this is much worse.
Android and derivative devices after and including version 2.2 are vulnerable, Drake wrote in a blog post. Devices running Android versions prior to Jelly Bean (roughly 11% of devices) are at the worst risk due to inadequate exploit mitigations.
Heres how the exploit works(emphasis added):
Attackers only need your mobile number, using which they can remotely execute code via a specially crafted media file delivered via [multimedia message]. A fully weaponized successful attack could even delete the message before you see it. You will only see the notification. These vulnerabilities are extremely dangerous because they do not require that the victim take any action to be exploited. Unlike spear-phishing, where the victim needs to open a PDF file or a link sent by the attacker, this vulnerability can be triggered while you sleep. Before you wake up, the attacker will remove any signs of the device being compromised and you will continue your day as usual  with a trojaned phone.
After Drake identified Stagefright back in April, he and the security firm reported it to Google, which runs Android operating systems, and provided patches to protect vulnerable users. Google, Drake wrote, acted quickly to fix the problem, but he went on to say thats only the beginning of what will be a very lengthy process of update deployment.
This is because devices require a firmware update, which Drake noted forAndroid devices have traditionally taken a long time to reach users. He wrote that devices older than 18 months might not even receive an update.
We hope that members of the Android ecosystem will recognize the severity of these issues and take immediate action. In addition to fixing these individual issues, we hope they will also fix any business processes that prevent or slow the uptake of such fixes, Drake wrote.
Drake suggested that Android users contact their device manufacturer or carrier to determine if the appropriate security patch has been applied to their system.
A Google representative told Forbes in a statement that its manufacturers would be deploying the appropriate patches and noted that most Android devices, including all newer devices, have multiple technologies that are designed to make exploitation more difficult. Android devices also include anapplication sandboxdesigned to protect user data and other applications on the device.
The good news in this case is thatZimperium doesnt think the flaw has been exploited yet, Wired reported.

Need a cool party trick? This might just be it.
A new video posted online this week aims to explain how to skin a watermelon. Mark Rober walks viewers through the process, which he says takes about 10 minutes to complete.
The instructions call for two watermelons, of similar shape and size. Step one is to shave off the exterior of one of the watermelons, first using a knife and then smoothing the surface with a dish-washing sponge. The second step is to cut the other watermelon in half and then gut it as one normally would.
Combining the shaved watermelon with the hollow shell should leave the individual with a watermelon that appears to have been skinned.

Rasheed Abdul Aziz walked into a Texas church Sunday afternoon dressed in camouflage pants, tactical vest, boots and a camouflage helmet. A pistol rested in his waistband.
He would later proclaim that he was on a mission from Allah, witnesses said.

As Aziz entered theCorinth Missionary Baptist Church in Bullard, Texas, around 1 p.m., he asked a deacon where he could find the pastor, the Tyler Morning Telegraph reported. He just wanted to see him for prayer, he told the deacon. Although the mornings worship service was long over, the church was still bustling with people: children played in the fellowship hall, church members planning an upcoming fall fest, and Pastor John Johnson III sitting in the conference room working with his teenage son.
Every hair on my neck just stood up, Johnson said of the moment Aziz walked into the conference room. It was almost like you could just like feel the presence of just negative energy.
According to the Morning Telegraph, Aziz almost immediately became irate, ranting that he was a man of Islam who had demons chasing him and was instructed to slay the infidels and kill any Christian or Jew who did not abide by the teachings of Islam.
He said people are going to die today, thats what he said to me, Johnson told KLTV-TV.
Pastor John Johnson III (Image Source: KLTV)
But Johnson, 45, remained calm and asked the man what he could do for him as he stepped between him and the door to the rest of the church. Besides being the pastor of Corinth Missionary Baptist, Johnson works full-time with troubled youth as a student services intervention specialist at a nearby school. Hes also a former parole officer and has been trained in crisis prevention, verbal de-escalation and working with mentally ill offenders.
So Johnson told the man to sit down and offered to pray for him and get him a cool drink. He said he needed to take care of the children quickly  his excuse to step out into the hall to alert his wife and another church member that Aziz had a gun.
Immediately my mind went to the fact that I knew we had several children and young members that were playing and running in the fellowship hall. I mouthed to them, This man has a weapon, I need you guys to go, Johnson told KLTV.
And as another church member already had dialed 911, Johnson decided to go, too.
We can get another church. We can get more walls, but we cannot get new people, the Morning Telegraph said he told his wife.
Aziz was arrested later that afternoon by Smith County law enforcement while in a subdivision, still dressed in his camo and tactical gear  his pistol still by side. He was charged with felony possession of a firearm and taken to the Smith County Jail where he is expected to face more charges from Cherokee County, where the church is located.
But even after his arrest, Azizs interactions with the church werent finished. Police said Aziz may have returned to the church after he and the congregation left to slip a note under the front door, which a deacon found Monday morning.

My name is Rasheed Abdul Aziz. You helped me at a time of need. This house is blessed by God & all faiths. Muslim, Jew & the Christian shall all gather here in Peace and Justice for God as a whole for the betterment of mankind as a whole. I thank you, the note read.
Johnson said that note was in stark contradiction to what he did in deed and statement, but said he is grateful that God gave him the mindset and clarity to be able to defuse the situation.
It was as if we had trained, but we hadnt, Johnson said.
Corinth Missionary Baptist has already changed the visitor protocol and will purchase security cameras in the event of a future incident.
Do not get caught thinking that this only happens in other places, in big places, Johnson warned other pastors.



Earbuds are often an imperfect invention.
Sometimes they wont stay in. Sometimes youre faced with the one bud in, one bud out scenario if you wish to hear anything other than whats streaming through your device. And dont get started on the knotty cord situation.

Thats why the creators of Batbandcame up with something thats cordless and bypasses your outer ears all together, allowing you to listen through bone conduction and hear through your skull.
Image source: Batband/Kickstarter
It wasnt a single epiphany moment that lead us to the idea behind Batband, but more rather the gradual realization that there should be more to mobile sound than headphones that isolate you totally or boomboxes that blast music out, Batband creators, Key Kawamura & Ali Ganjavian, the co-founders of Studio Banana Things, told TheBlaze in an email. So we started to explore this in-between world that would allow you to listen to music but also to the world that surrounds you. Technology was the means, not the end.
Heres how it works:
BATBAND works via bone conduction, consisting of transducers that emit sound waves perceived by your private inner ear, thus freeing your social outer ear. Sound waves are transmitted at a frequency that can be conducted through the bones of the skull. Your ears remain free, therefore you get to hear twice as much, without compromising on comfort, quality or style.
Image source: Batband/Kickstarter
Bone conduction technology,Kawamura andGanjavian wrote, has been around since the 1970s, used by the military and in medicine. There are other bone conduction headphones on the market as well, but on Kickstarter the creators explained that they believe Batbands benefits result from its high fidelity sound conduction, its incorporated microphone, and its sleek and intelligent design coupled with its qualitative finishings.

While the Batband creators acknowledged that traditional headphones and earbuds have a time and a place, they think this headband sound system serves for people who might need to hear their outside environment as well, like people who are driving or bicycling, for example.
Batband is extremely comfortable. The design team kept ergonomics always in mind as we knew we wanted to make it a very wearable product for a lifestyle on the go. Jumping and extreme running compromise the grip on your head so we dont recommend Usain Bolt to wear his Batband next time he tries to break the 100m world record,Kawamura andGanjavian quipped.
Image source: Batband/Kickstarter
The Batband project on Kickstarter surpassed its fundraising goal of $150,000, raising over $261,000 at the time of this posting, and it has 39 days of funding to go.
The overall price for Batband will be $250, but there are some funding opportunities still available for as low as $149.


According to The Hill, the Democratic money movers are lamenting Hillarys lack of a personal touch thats making fundraising a bit difficult.
The donors, who have contributed some of the biggest checks to President Obama and the Democratic Party, are disappointed by the lack of face time, overall communication and gratitude from Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.
Fundraising is not a natural strong suit for Hillary, one top Democratic fundraiser bluntly said.
Hillary Clinton is lacking a certain personal touch, the person said. The source added that the former secretary of State publicly, is a little stiff.
Image source: Mario Tama/Getty Images
Whats the fix? More Bill  hes got got the schmoozing creds:
She doesnt come across as naturally comfortable in these settings, the donor said. Bill Clinton is the complete opposite. The more social an environment, the more at ease he feels.
Bill Clinton is starting to make the rounds at fundraisers  he attended his first two big-dollar events in Chicago last week. And the Clinton campaign says there are plans for the former president to appear at more fundraisers for his wife this fall.
Clinton  who famously opened up the Lincoln Bedroom during his presidency  is also set to attend fundraisers for Priorities USA, the super-PAC backing his wifes bid.
The potential problem in that strategy? It makes Hillary look like a D.C. insider. Bill even agrees, telling Town & Country magazine last spring: I think its important, and Hillary does too, that she go out there as if shes never run for anything before and establish her connection with the voters. And that my role should primarily be as a backstage adviser to her until we get much, much closer to the election.
So, whats a Democratic Party to do?
Forget Hillarys alleged outsider status and get the former POTUS back out there:
Face time with the candidate has been limited to brief grip-and-grins in photo lines after an event, with no phone calls and few meetings with small groups.
The sentiment that Hillary Clinton isnt doing enough for donors is echoed far and wide among the relatively small circle of people who like to feel appreciated not only for writing large checks but for their countless hours fundraising for the candidate. []
The assumption is that everyone is just going to get behind them because theyre the only game in town, the donor said. But this is why theres an opening for someone like Joe Biden.
If this was a business, youd never run it that way, the donor said. Ive been unbelievably shocked by the lack of basic courtesy.
A second donor, who has given money to the Clinton campaign, agreed. There needs to be more than a 10-second photo-op in a long photo line. The campaign needs someone to cultivate these relationships. The person who can do that ably is Bill Clinton. []
There is no better surrogate for a candidate, [venture capitalist and Clinton donor J.B. Pritzker] said. He is out there now and he is helping and it can only be a big plus for the campaign.
Thats right. Democratic donors think that, without Bill, Vice President Joe Biden is looking better every day.

Brilliant Books in Traverse City, Michigan is offering customers who bought Harper Lees new controversial novel, Go Set a Watchman, a full refund.
In a statement posted online, the independent bookstore claimed that the novel was not a sequel or prequel to Lees bestselling novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Instead, Brilliant Books claims, the novel was a first draft that was originally, and rightfully, rejected.

We suggest you view this work as an academic insight rather than as a nice summer novel. This situation is comparable to James Joyces stunning work A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and his original draft Stephen Hero, the statement read. Hero was initially rejected, and Joyce reworked it into the classic Portrait. Hero was eventually released as an academic piece for scholars and fansnot as a new Joyce novel. We would have been delighted to see Go Set A Watchman receive a similar fate.
CORAL GABLES, FL  JULY 14: The newly released book authored by Harper Lee, Go Set a Watchman, is seen on sale at the Books and Books store on July 14, 2015 in Coral Gables, Florida. The book went on sale today and is Lees first book since she released her classic, To Kill A Mockingbird ,55 years ago. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
It is disappointing and frankly shameful to see our noble industry parade and celebrate this as Harper Lees New Novel, the statement continued. This is pure exploitation of both literary fans and a beloved American classic (which we hope has not been irrevocably tainted.) We therefore encourage you to view Go Set A Watchmanwith intellectual curiosity and careful consideration; a rough beginning for a classic, but only that.
Peter Makin, the bookstores owner, told Melville House Books that the store blamed HarperCollins Publishers for their desperate attempt to get folks to buy the book before they realized what it actually was.
We believe GSAW should have been an academic piece for scholars and fans, as we said. Not marketed as the next big thing, Makin said. But I do think this whole episode points to a much larger issue in the publishing world. Theres a much repeated myth that independent bookstores are thriving. They arent. Some might be, and yes, there are more of them than ever, but that increase in capacity isnt matched by an increase in overall book sales at independent bookstores.
Makin told the Detroit Free Press that one woman who bought the book from their store expressed her disappointment in the novel.
Her disappointment was palpable, so I immediately apologized for being complicit in the marketing, and offered her a refund, which she accepted, Makin said. I realized then that we needed to offer the same thing to all our customers, of which there were dozens across the country, and explain why.
We are not offering refunds based on the quality of the book or its content. We are offering refunds to those who bought the book based on marketing that led them to believe it was something other than what it actually was, he added. If you find yourself complicit in misleading a customer, you should make amends. Again, this isnt about whether they liked the book. Its about being misled by the marketing.
Makin said his store will continue to see Lees novel but wish for readers to know exactly what they are purchasing.
CBS News reported that the novel set sales records on the day it was released.


Rita Richardson is a frequent JCPenney shopper.
Thats why I read their ad and look for sales, themom from Sebastian, Florida, told WPTV-TV.
But when she got an eyeful of the stores circular last week, Richardson couldnt believe her eyes.
Image source: WPTV-TV
I did a double take when I saw the ad for this shirt right on the front page, she said.
The ad was for a tank top emblazoned with a written message that advocates, glorifies gun violence, Richardson told WPTV.
The phrase causing her distress? Suns Out, Guns Out.
Image source: WPTV-TV
Guns, in this case, is a nickname for arm muscles.

But Richardson opined that the phrase could be taken the wrong way. I would take it off the shelves, immediately.
No such luck.WPTV spotted the Suns Out, Guns Out tank top for sale at a local JCPenney.

I just thought it was sad that a major retailer like JCPenney would want its brand associated with such a product, she said.
The store didnt respond to a request for comment regarding the tank top, WPTV said.

President Barack Obama said Wednesday he shared Pope Franciss commitment to religious freedom, but Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee told TheBlaze his actions havent demonstrated that.
Id love to see a little bit of it practiced, Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, told TheBlaze shortly after speaking at the conservative Values Voter Summit.

Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, speaks during the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, Sept. 25, 2015.

Id love to see religious liberty practiced with the Little Sisters of the Poor. Id love to see it practiced with the Green family of Hobby Lobby, Huckabee continued. Id love to see religious liberty exercise for Kim Davis and Aaron and Melissa Klein.
On Wednesday, during the welcoming ceremony for Pope Francis at the White House, Obama said, So we stand with you in defense of religious freedom and interfaith dialogue, knowing that people everywhere must be able to live out their faith free from fear and free from intimidation.
Huckabee was referring to the Obama administrations lawsuit to force the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic charity, to pay for contraception and abortion-inducing drugs for their employees, even though it violates their religious views. The Supreme Court ruled last year that Hobby Lobby cannot be required to cover the cost of the drugs.
He also referred to Kim Davis, the county clerk in Kentucky who was hauled off to jail at one point for refusing a court order to issue gay marriage licenses, and also the Klein family, which owns a bakery in Oregon and was fined $135,000 by the state for refusing to cater a gay wedding.
If he really believes in it, then he needs to turn the Justice Department loose in defending the religious liberty of people whose faith has been completely trampled upon by over reaching government actions, Huckabee said.

The online cheating site AshleyMadison.com, which has nearly 37 million users and encourages committed spouses to have an affair, has been hacked.
Brian Krebs, of the cybersecurity blog Krebs on Security, first reported the breach last week and said that large caches of user databases and financial records belonging to the websites parent company, Avid Life Media, were compromised. ALM also owns the hookup sites Cougar Life and Established Men, according to Krebs on Security.

Were not denying this happened. Like us or not, this is still a criminal act.ALM CEO Noel Biderman said, adding that the company is working diligently and feverishly to remove information from its websites.
The individual or group responsible for releasing the private information wrote in an online manifesto next to the stolen data that it did so in response to the alleged lies ALM told its users  that they can pay $19 and have their information completely erased from their profiles.
The full delete feature reportedly promised users removal of site usage history and personally identifiable information from the site. But the hackers claim that just isnt true, and that personally identifiable information such as names and addresses arent really taken down, despite ALM raking in nearly $2 million from full delete fees just last year.
Avid Life Media has been instructed to take Ashley Madison and Established Men offline permanently in all forms, or we will release all customer records, including profiles with all the customers secret sexual fantasies and matching credit card transactions, real names and addresses, and employee documents and emails. The other websites may stay online, read the hacker or hackers threats.
Additionally, the individual or group threatened that it would keep releasing more user information for each day the websites remained online. In a statement released the same day the hack was first reported by Krebs on Security, the company said that it had secured its websites and closed any unauthorized access points.
We are working with law enforcement agencies, which are investigating this criminal act. Any and all parties responsible for this act of cyberterrorism will be held responsible, the statement read.Avid Life Media has the utmost confidence in its business, and with the support of leading experts in IT securitywe will continue to be a leader in the services we provide.
Biderman said he suspects that whoever is responsible once had legitimate access to the companys networks, either as a former employee or contractor.
Without giving any more specifics, he added,Ive got their profile right in front of me, all their work credentials. It was definitely a person here that was not an employee but certainly had touched our technical services.
As Krebs noted, the online manifesto appears to support that theory, since whoever stole the information was apparently familiar with one of the companys top officers, the director of security.
Our one apology is to Mark Steele. You did everything you could, but nothing you could have done could have stopped this, the message reads.
The breach occurred less than three months after more than 3.5 million users personal information was stolen from the website Adult Friend Finder. While Adult Friend Finder isnt intended solely to facilitate communications for spouses seeking to have extramarital affairs, the stolen data could indicate which users are married and which ones arent, Gizmodo reported.

While the upcoming August 10 edition of the New York Times Combined Print & E-Book Nonfiction Best Sellers list shows that Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to capture the publics imagination more than any other presidential contender, her memoir continues to be bested by books anathema to hers.
Ms. Clintons memoir, Hard Choices, comes in at no. 8 on the list, but three books by conservative authors are positioned above hers, with another book perceived as critical of the Clintons debuting just a handful of spots below.
