module.exports = `WASHINGTON — The last time they met, Capitol Police Officer Nicholas Simons performed CPR on Gary Langston after he suffered cardiac arrest outside a Senate office building.
On Tuesday, they met under happier circumstances — Langston wanted to thank Simons in person for saving his life.
“I know you were just doing your job, but it was a really important job that day,” Langston said when they met at Rep. André Carson’s (D-Ind.) office.
Langston, 61, the president of the Indiana Trucking Association, was in Washington last May talking to Indiana lawmakers when he began to feel ill. He sat down on a bench to rest before another meeting, and then the next thing he knew, “people were pulling on me and yelling my name,” he recounted on Tuesday.
Simons, 28, was inside the Hart Senate Office Building and rushed out, along with other officers. He performed CPR and used an automated external defibrillator on Langston, and Langston survived.
The officer had recently done additional training in CPR to supplement the standard training all officers receive. He said he was inspired to do the training by a friend who had recently used CPR to save an infant.
The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund named Simons officer of the month in February, and he will be honored with other officers as part of this week’s National Police Week.
“These are our true heroes,” Carson said of Simons and other officers.
Langston and a number of others in his office took CPR training in March, although he said he hopes he never has to use it. He said after the meeting that he was grateful to Simons for helping him come home to his children, a 12-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old son.
“It’s not until you have a close call like that that you really appreciate life,” he said. “I have a couple little kids, and when I got back home and realized that I almost never went back home, that’s when I really realized what it was all about. You just don’t know what to say to that person other than thanks.”

PHILADELPHIA -- Pope Francis addressed thousands of people gathered at Philadelphias historic Independence Mall on Saturday afternoon, just feet away from the building where the U.S. Declaration of Independence and Constitution were adopted. In his speech, the pope tied America's founding to the cause of religious freedom, championing diversity and compassion for those in need.
But while American Catholic bishops and conservative evangelical Christians have rallied around religious freedom in recent years -- filing lawsuits against Obamacare's contraception mandate and citing religious beliefs to avoid serving gay couples or allowing them to obtain marriage licenses -- Francis notably avoided hot-button political issues.giulio napolitano Pope Francis visited Washington, New York and Philadelphia during his trip to the United States. In his speeches, he spoke extensively about human dignity, the rights of immigrants and the poor, and the importance of protecting the environment.   Instead, at the same lectern that President Abraham Lincoln used to deliver his Gettysburg Address, the Argentine-born pope offered a broader view of freedom of religion, saying that faithful communities' power goes beyond private worship to how they serve society by the message they proclaim.Like in most of his previous U.S. addresses, the pope did not mention abortion, instead referencing Gods gift of life in all its stages. He didnt talk about gay marriage, but instead spoke more broadly of a modern tyranny that tries to reduce religion to a subculture without right to a voice in the public square -- a common cry of conservative activists reacting to the successes of the LGBT rights movement.But soon after, Francis said religion is also abused to stir hatred and brutality, and urged followers of all faiths to advocate for peace, tolerance and respect for the dignity and rights of others.Religion calls communities to seek the transcendent dimension of human existence and our irreducible freedom in the face of every claim to absolute power, the pope said.Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press A crowd fills Independence Mall ahead of Pope Francis' speech in Philadelphia on Sept. 26, 2015.In a nod to the Quakers who helped establish Philadelphia and were inspired by a profound evangelical sense of the dignity of each individual, Francis praised what he called the American spirit of concern for the dignity of all, especially the weak and the vulnerable.The popes address followed a nearly four-hour, multicultural program on the mall in front of a crowd of thousands that grew by the hour as his appearance approached. The event featured a Mexican mariachi band, Vietnamese fan dancers, Argentine tango performers, hip-hop artists and remarks by Archbishop of Los Angeles Jose Gomez, who oversees the largest Catholic diocese in the U.S., and one that is majority Hispanic. Catholic families from Texas and California held signs in Spanish thanking the pope for his visit, while others held flags from the Dominican Republic and Argentina.One family brought a sign in Spanishthat read, "We are all children of immigrants."Delighted Hispanic family watching Pope arrive. Their sign says: "we are all children of immigrants" #PopeinPhilly pic.twitter.com/3hGwVRqG8x Austen Ivereigh (@austeni)    September 26, 2015The day also included remarks on global religious repression by Robert George, the chairman of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, and a testimony by Mariam Ibrahim, a Sudanese woman who famously escaped a death sentence for being Christian. Two dozen other speakers and performers hit upon topics ranging from the importance of national parks like Independence National Historical Park to the power of immigrants. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, for example, spoke of Philadelphia as a welcoming city, no matter your ethnicity, income or sexual orientation.Francis -- who has used his U.S. visit to rally for protecting the environment, aiding the poor, abolishing the death penalty and encouraging Catholics and non-Catholics alike to foster what he calls the common good -- made a plea to the diverse crowd, which included thousands of Hispanics, not to forget their heritage.   Alex Brandon/Associated Press A woman holds an icon as she watches Pope Francis celebrate Mass outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia on Sept. 26, 2015.   Many of you have immigrated to this country at great personal cost, but in the hope of building a new life, the pope said, addressing Hispanics in particular. Do not be discouraged by whatever challenges and hardships you face. I ask you not to forget that, like those who came here before you, you bring many gifts to your new nation. You should never be ashamed of your traditions.Do not forget the lessons you learned from your elders, which are something you can bring to enrich the life of this American land. I repeat, do not be ashamed of what is part of you, your life blood, Francis added.You are also called to be responsible citizens, and to contribute fruitfully to the life of the communities in which you live. I think in particular of the vibrant faith which so many of you possess, the deep sense of family life and all those other values which you have inherited. By contributing your gifts, you will not only find your place here, you will help to renew society from within."

Every week, we bring you one overlooked aspect of the stories that made news in recent days. You noticed the media forgot all about another story's basic facts? Tweet @TheWorldPost or let us know on our Facebook page.
More civilians have been killed or injured by explosive weapons in Yemen this year than in any other country in the world, including Syria or Iraq, according to a devastating reportpublished this week. Yemens war may have dropped out of the headlines, but it rages on as deadly as ever. Friday marked six months since a Saudi-led coalition launched airstrikes to push back the advance of Yemens Houthi rebels across the country. Amid an ongoing stalemate, coalition airstrikes haveintensifiedin recent weeks.The report from the UK-based charity Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) and U.N. humanitarian agency OCHA tracked deaths and injuries from explosive violence in Yemen since the beginning of the year -- including weapons like aircraft bombs, tank shells, mortars and improvised explosive devices.
It recorded 5,239 deaths and injuries from explosive violence as of July 31, of whom 4,486 were civilians. Only Syria, where AOAV reported 4,205 civilian deaths and injuries from explosive violence this year, and Iraq, with 3,327 casualties, came anywhere close to the toll in Yemen.
Credit: Hani Mohammed/ASSOCIATED PRESS Some 4,855 people have been reported killed and almost 25,000 injured in Yemen since March, according to the U.N.   The high proportion of civilian casualties -- 86 percent -- underlines persistent warnings from humanitarian and human rights groups that ordinary Yemenis are bearing the brunt of the war.
The report's figures are just a portion of the total death toll in Yemen. While the report tracked reports of explosive weapons casualties since January, the United Nations gave much higher overall casualty figures provided by Yemeni health facilities. In all,4,855 people have been reported killedand almost 25,000 injured in Yemen since March, according to the U.N. More than450 of those were children. The U.N. warns the actual number could be much higher as hospitals are closed or rendered inaccessible by the war, and people who die before making it to the hospital are not reported.
After the Houthis, a mainly Shiite group from Yemens north, extended their control over the country last year, neighboring Saudi Arabia warned of an Iranian-backed coup in the country and formed a coalition of Arab allies aiming to reinstall the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Since the coalition launched airstrikes on March 25, a plethora of different groups have stepped into the fray: loyalists of former president Ali Abdulleh Saleh supporting the Houthis and southern separatists and other local militia fighting against them. Militants loyal to the Yemen-based branches of Al Qaedaand to the Islamic Statehave both tried to exploit the chaos.
Credit: Hani Mohammed/ASSOCIATED PRESS People search for survivors amid the rubble of houses destroyed in a Saudi-led airstrike in Sanaa, Yemen, Monday, Sept. 21, 2015.The war in Yemen means that "an already vulnerable population is now faced with a country reduced to rubble," a report from a UK charity found.   Yemen was already the poorest country in the Arab world before the war. Fighting and a coalition-imposed blockade have now left nearly half of Yemens 26 million people without access to basic food supplies.
An already vulnerable population is now faced with a country reduced to rubble by falling bombs and rockets, Robert Perkins, AOAV senior weapons researcher and the author of the report, said in a press statement. Their homes destroyed, their families torn apart, it will take a many years to recover from the last few terrible months in Yemen.Human rights groups have accused both the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels of indiscriminately bombing or shelling civilians areas and urged an international inquiry into violations of international law.


The Netherlands led an effort this week to launch such an investigation, askingthe United Nations Human Rights Council on Thursday to send a fact-finding mission to Yemen.


Saudi Arabia has been lobbying hard to fend off an independent international inquiry and stepped up a PR campaign about its role in Yemens war ahead of the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York next week, Foreign Policy reported. The Gulf kingdom and its allies submitted an alternative resolution to the Human Rights Council this week condemning abuses committed by the Houthis and calling for the Saudi-backed government to lead an inquiry.



   Credit: Hani Mohammed/ASSOCIATED PRESS "All sides have displayed a callous disregard for civilian life.   The U.S., which has provided intelligence and logistical supportto the Saudi-led bombing campaign, has not said which resolution it will support. Washington has expressed concernabout the mounting civilian casualties but declined to rebuke its ally at a sensitive time amid the recent nuclear deal with Saudi archrival Iran.


U.S. officials at the U.N. are deeply skeptical about what the Saudis are doing in Yemen but will not piss them off because of concerns it could further strain relations, a senior U.N.-based official told Foreign Policy.


Human rights group Amnesty International on Friday urged world leaders to support an independent inquiry.


"With no end to this deadly conflict in sight and a spiraling humanitarian crisis, civilian suffering is at an all-time high," James Lynch, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Amnesty International, said in the statement. In the six months since the Saudi Arabia-led coalition began their campaign in Yemen, all sides have displayed a callous disregard for civilian life.VIDEOToilets need to compete with mobile phones and televisions as desirable lifestyle products in order to achieve sanitation for all. For one-third of the world's population, a clean, safe toilet -- something many of us take for granted -- remains out of reach. The Millennium Development Goal target of halving the proportion of people without sustainable access to basic sanitation wasn't even nearly reached. In fact, the target has been missed by almost 700 million people. The proposed sustainable development goals (SDGs) include a standalone goal dedicated to water and sanitation -- Goal #6: "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all," and targets to end open defecation and halve the proportion of untreated wastewater. So how do we ensure the success of this goal? Usage is key Firstly, it is crucial that we are clear that for this goal to succeed, we will need to see a clean, safe toilet and sanitation being USED by all by 2030. As we work to improve access to sanitation across the globe, it is critical that we address sanitation behavior. It will not be enough to simply ensure access to sanitation -- people need to be using toilets in order to realize the health, dignity, economic, and gender benefits of achieving 100 percent sanitation coverage. Installing toilets in India, for instance, without addressing behavioral change, has resulted in thousands of free toilets becoming storage sheds or chicken coops, while the owners continue to defecate outside. A survey by RICE found that in India many still consider open defecation to be preferable and "part of a wholesome, healthy, virtuous life."Driving behavioral change is key to ending open defecation. Rational messages used by educational campaigns in the past have not gotten through. Toilets need to compete for priority on an emotional level, rather than a rational level. We need to motivate people by appealing to their pride and dignity, and position toilet use as aspirational, associated with improved social status.Driving Demand Generating desire for toilets among BoP ["bottom of pyramid," or world's largest but poorest socio-economic group] populations is crucial. The chief obstacle in promoting sanitation is not the ability of BoP populations to afford it, but that they do not prioritize sanitation over other investments, like cell phones and televisions. While only 40 percent of Indians have an improved sanitation facility, current statistics show that around 77 percent have a mobile-phone subscription. Toilets need to be able to compete in terms of desirability with lifestyle items like a mobile phone for people to prioritize investing in improved sanitation. In order to drive demand, the image of a toilet will need to be transitioned from dark, dirty, smelly to bright, clean and happy. And we need the reality to match this image. We need to design the toilet to be a wonderful place to visit, and provide populations with a product that is well-designed, well lit and ventilated, and easy to clean -- a much more comfortable, convenient and enjoyable option than open defecation. And simultaneously, we have to ensure the supply of good quality and affordable toilets. The product needs to be so desirable that people will want to own and use a toilet. And we can appeal to people's sense of pride, and their competitive nature, encouraging them to decorate their toilets, painting them with bright colors, using stencil designs on the outside walls to show off to their neighbors. Owning and using a toilet needs to become a trend, and eventually the norm. Tackling the sanitation taboo As we work to see sanitation prioritized by the end-users, we also need to continue working to ensure that sanitation is a top priority for global leaders. Sanitation and water being included as a standalone goal signals that the issue is starting to become more of a global priority. Sanitation has slowly become more of a priority for world leaders in the 14 years since World Toilet Organization was founded on the 19th November 2001 (now celebrated annually as UN World Toilet Day). However, the current level of prioritization is still far from what is needed, especially given the scale and impact of the sanitation crisis. It's time for toilets to be treated as an urgent global priority. We need to continue to address the taboo nature of sanitation, by calling a toilet a toilet and not being afraid to talk about shit. As former Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan said, "No other issue suffers such disparity between its human importance and its political priority." I have a vision of a world with clean, beautiful, safe and "happy" toilets being used by all. By addressing behavioral change, driving demand for improved sanitation and continuing to advocate for sanitation to be prioritized at the highest levels, I'm confident we can achieve this vision and reach one-third of the world with improved sanitation, positively impacting the lives of some 2.4 billion people.

Pictures on social media show what appear to be girls riding a sea turtle on a Brevard County beach during the critical sea turtle nesting season.
One picture shows what appears to be a young girl looking as if she's riding a large sea turtle, either sitting on or hovering over it with her hands in the air.
Her face and tattoos are blurred in the image above to protect her identity, in accordance with our Crime Guidelines, since the authenticity of the pictures remains under investigation.
The other picture shows another girl, but her hands appeared to be pressed down on the turtle's back. She was either sitting or leaning over its shell.
The pictures were labeled with stickers indicating they were taken at Melbourne Beach over the last few days. They have since gone viral on social media across Central Florida, appalling many people, including Christine Crowe, who spoke with us at the beach on Friday.
"I think it's abusive. I think it's criminal," said Crowe. "The signs are very clear. These are protected species. Take care of them, and if you're not going to respect them, they need to suffer the consequences."
It is illegal in Florida to harm, harass or take sea turtles, and Fish and Wildlife investigators are on the case after receiving an anonymous tip.
Investigators said they have spoken by phone to one of the girls and will interview her about the pictures.
The photos have also gotten the attention of the Sea Turtle Preservation Society, based in nearby Indialantic.
"People are reacting the way they are about it, with outrage and disgust," said David Hochberg, the society's chairman.
Hochberg said education is key when it comes to the law protecting these animals, but in this case, he believes an example needs to be set.
"If something is not done, that sends out the wrong message that, 'Even though these laws are in place, nothing is going to happen to me if I break them. So, what's to stop me from doing it?'" said Hochberg.
Sea turtles are aquatic and buoyant and struggle with their own weight to come ashore to lay eggs, Hochberg explained. If a person sits on one, it could do serious damage to the turtle's ribs or sternum.
Florida Fish and Wildlife would decide on potential charges, which could be as serious as hundreds, perhaps thousands of dollars in fines, or a felony charge of harassing a sea turtle.
Last summer, a federal judge fined and sentenced two men to community service for luring an adult manatee and calf to a Cocoa Beach dock with a water hose, and then "cannonball" jumping onto the adult. They, too, recorded the stunt, which went viral and eventually led to their arrest.WASHINGTON -- One of the nation's most recognizable names in climate science, Dr. James Hansen, released a new paper this week warning that even 2 degrees Celsius of global warming may be "highly dangerous" for humanity.


The paper, which will be published online in the European Geosciences Union journalAtmospheric Chemistry and PhysicsDiscussion later this week, projects sea levels rising as much as 10 feet in the next 50 years.


The paper notes there is evidence indicating that average temperatures just 1 degree Celsius warmer than today caused sea levels to rise 16 to 30 feet and fed extreme storms thousands of years ago.


Hansen and 16 co-authors drafted the paper as a message to policymakers that current greenhouse-gas reduction goals are not strong enough. World leaders have committed to limiting average warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), a goal articulated in the Copenhagen Accordin 2009 and reiterated by G7 leaders in June.


"The message for policymakers is that we have a global crisis that calls for international cooperation to reduce emissions as rapidly as practical," wrote the authors.


Their projections are based on an anticipated accelerated melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica due to rising atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. The melting ice sheets will put more cold, fresh water into the oceans, changing circulation patterns and ultimately causing even more melting of the ice sheets -- thus causing sea levels to rise much, much faster than other projections have forecast.


"We conclude that continued high emissions will make multi-meter sea level rise practically unavoidable and likely to occur this century," the scientists wrote. "Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea level rise could be devastating."


Hansen, who was the director of NASA'sGoddardInstitute for Space Studiesuntil April 2013 and is now an adjunct professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University, has been warning about climate threats for years. He's moved from dispassionately investigating the science to actively advocating for specific solutions to the problem. As Eric Holthaus at Slate put it, Hansen "is known for being alarmist and also right."


The paper has already ruffled some, including Associated Press science writer Seth Borenstein, who said on Twitter that he would not cover it-- primarily because it had not yet been peer-reviewed, a process that allows other scientists to critique the work.


The Washington Post's Chris Mooney asked other climate experts to weigh in on the paper. While many said it raised key discussion points, Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research called it "provocative and intriguing but rife with speculation and 'what if' scenarios."

Over the past weeks, hearts have both ached and felt relief from images of the refugee crisis in Europe. The photo of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi lifeless on a beach in Turkey was haunting. One can imagine his mother tying his shoes and ruffling his hair the morning before they boarded a raft for the trip that would mark the end of their lives. They were simply seeking safety.At the same time there was a sense of relief and justice when video aired of German citizens clapping and greeting the first Syrian refugees to arrive on trains in Munich, Germany. The German government has agreed to accept 800,000 Syrians. Last year, the United States resettled just 1,500 Syrians. Certainly the U.S. can do better.Yes, America can and should do better by Syrian refugees, and refugees and asylees worldwide. In 1980 the U.S. resettled a record 207,000 refugees. Yet last year, in the midst of undoubtedly the worst global refugee crisis since World War II, the U.S. offered up only 70,000 slots for refugees total.The president will announce the numbers of refugees to be admitted during fiscal year 2016 at the end of September. Now is the time for Americans, and persons of faith and conscience especially, to advocate for higher refugee admissions from all countries. And, if there is true commitment to welcoming the stranger, one more step must be taken.The U.S. government must stop locking in detention centers refugees and asylees arriving daily at the U.S.-Mexico border. Their plight is no different than the scores of refugees and asylees arriving in Europe. All want freedom from harm and danger. If Americans care how refugees and asylees are greeted in Europe, the nation also must be adamant about how these global citizens are welcomed on U.S. soil.In 2014, tens of thousands of Central American children and families arrived seeking protection in the U.S. They were unwelcomed by the Obama administration, which housed them in private, for-profit detention centers. In fact, the government built two new detention centers and increased the nation's capacity to imprison asylum-seeking families from 85 to almost 4,000 families.Regardless of whether refugees have been vetted before arriving in the U.S., or whether they arrive with no documentation or prior vetting, the asylum process makes clear that both means are equal in the eyes of the law. Both the Central Americans arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border and the Syrians arriving in Europe have claims for protection, have not been previously vetted, and have in many cases travelled with false documents via smugglers to get them to their destination. Both groups have suffered on the journey and both, under national law and international agreement, have a right to have their claims for protection heard without penalty or being returned to the homes they fled.As Americans pray for refugees and their safe passage in Europe, the country -- and especially people of faith and conscience -- must also look at our own borders. Petition that immigration enforcement not impede the path of those seeking protection in the U.S., and demand the end of family detention and the detention of all asylum seekers.Ahead of Pope Francis arrival in Philadelphia, indigenous leaders from across the Americas -- from the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in upstate New York to the Qom Nation in Argentina and many places in between -- have gathered in the city to urge the pontiff to rescind the Doctrine of Discovery, a series of papal bulls from the 15th century that justified European colonization of newly "discovered" lands. One particularpapal bull, issued by Pope Nicholas V in 1455, authorized Christian nations "to invade, search out, capture, vanquish, and subdue all ... enemies of Christ," take their land and "reduce their persons to perpetual slavery."


The doctrine played a central role in centuries of colonization the world over and resulted in immense loss of land and life by indigenous peoples across the Americas.


"While our people were planting corn, they were planting flags," Oren Lyons, faithkeeper of the Onondaga Nation, said in an interview with The Huffington Post.


"The Doctrine of Discovery, from my point of view, from a religious point of view, is the justification for Christians taking the lands of non-Christian people," said Phil Arnold, a professor of religion at Syracuse University.


Long usedas a religious backing by colonial powers, the doctrine became the centerpiece of property and Indian law in the United States following the 1823 Supreme Court case Johnson v. Mintosh, Arnold explained. In that case,Justice John Marshall used the doctrine to support the majority opinion of the court, which found that Indians had a right to occupy, but could not own, the ancestral homelands where their people had lived, loved, worshipped, married, mourned and died for millennia.


"Since that time, the Doctrine of Discovery has basically been the mechanism by which Native people are denied access to their own lands and denied their own rights to be in their own lands," Arnold said.


The doctrine has had a significant influence on Indian law and set a precedent that resonates even in modern decisions. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- widely considered the most liberal justice on the Supreme Court -- even cited cases based upon the doctrine as recently as 2005 to deny a land claim brought before the court by the Oneida Nation.


For many native leaders today, the doctrine is a fundamental impediment to the realization ofindigenous rights to lands, resources and sovereignty. As they gatherin Philadelphia for ceremonies and protests, indigenous leaders are hopeful that Pope Francis, who has established himself as a voice for social justice and equality, will listen.


Indeed, Francis has made multiple attempts during his papacy to atone for wrongs committed by the Church against indigenous peoples.


During his visit to Ecuador in July, Francis apologized for the "grave sins" committed "against the native peoples of America in the name of God." And he voiced his support for indigenous rightsduring his speech to CongressThursday, stating, "Tragically, the rights of those who were here long before us were not always respected. For those peoples and their nations, from the heart of American democracy, I wish to reaffirm my highest esteem and appreciation.


But now, some indigenous leaders are insisting that words of solidarity and support are not enough. They are asking the pope to take actions to rescind and repudiate the Doctrine of Discovery,which would be a step towards implementing the Pope's statements and apologies to indigenous peoples.


They have pointed out that many other Christian denominations and organizations have already done so, including the Episcopal Church, the United Methodist Church, the Unitarian Universalists, the World Council of Churches, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the New York Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends -- just to name a few.


The Vatican has yet to publicly address the doctrine, and while it is unlikely that Pope Francis will do so, indigenous leaders are still pushing for what they believe is right.


"It would relieve a great deal of suffering," Lyons said.


It might also be a revolutionary act -- for a rather revolutionary pope.


"The pope repudiating the Doctrine of Discovery might have the effect of pulling the rug out from these legal frameworks that are all built on top of that religious or theological perspective," Arnold said. "And then there might be a future for further conversations -- in churches or in a variety of parishes -- that might spark a conversation about what justice would mean for indigenous peoples around the world."



The world could be one step closer to quick and inexpensive Ebola detection thanks to a teenager from Connecticut.


Olivia Hallisey, a junior at Greenwich High School, was awarded $50,000 in scholarship funds in the 2015 Google Science Fair for her innovation that detects Ebola. Olivia's invention costs $25 a test, can be stored and transported without refrigeration and determines if a person is infected within 3o minutes, according to the contests site.


Olivia was inspired to tackle the global issue after watching helplessly from home as more than 10,000 people diedfrom the recent epidemic that ravaged through West Africa, she told CNBC. She was particularly dismayed by the fact that, while early interventions can improve survival rates, current detection methods are costly, time-consuming and require complex tools and constant refrigeration, she noted in her projects description.


Olivia elicited guidance from her science research teacherand direction from past research according to Greenwich Time, and looked to detection mechanisms that have proven to work with other diseases, including HIV, Lyme disease and yellow fever.




We have to work togetherto find answers to the enormous challenges that threaten global health, our environment and our world, she told Greenwich Time.


The Connecticut teen, who hopes to one day become a physician and work with an aid organization like Doctors Without Borders, was named the Google Science Fair winner after the competition had been whittled down to 20 contestantsfrom across the globe. The fair is open to students in most countries between in the ages of 13 and 18.


Olivia hopes her success will inspire other girls interested in science and computers to pursue their passions.


"I would just encourage girls just to try it in the beginning, remind them that they don't have to feel naturally drawn or feel like they have a special talent for math or science, she told CNBC, but just really just look at something they are interested in and then think how to improve something or make it more enjoyable or relate it to their interests."

       8 Exercises to Reduce the Effects of Aging
      Using a mobile device? Go to m.huffingtonpost.com for huffpost mobile.WASHINGTON -- When House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) announced Friday that he would resign his speakership, he did so at a bittersweet moment. The sweet part is that after 20 years of trying,the former altar boy finally got a pope to address Congress, an achievement that so moved him he practically weptthrough the entire event.


The bitter part was that Boehner was once again caught in yet another government shutdown drama, with a recalcitrant supporting cast happy for Boehner to be the star of a show that flops every time.


Now, with a faction of conservative House Republicans again threatening to oust Boehner from leadership, he's resigning in an effort to sparethe institution leadership turmoil in addition to its usual dysfunction.Boehner's announcement makes a shutdown less likely.


"He is the tree character in Shel Silverstein's The Giving Tree. He did this for his friends who he didn't want to have to take a tough vote," said Sam Geduldig, a GOP operative close to Boehner. "Now all that's left is his stump for them to sit on. We're so proud of him."


Below is a look back at some of those other bitter and sweet moments from the speaker's time with the gavel.


A SAD CHRISTMAS:One of Boehner's saddest moments as speaker cametwo days before Christmas in 2011, when Boehner was all alone in thelower chamber so nobody could yell at him while the House approved a package of tax cuts that were about to expire.


Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) told reporters that December that he saw Boehner in the hallway and wished him a merry Christmas, adding that he told Boehner he "felt for him" and that Boehner's eyes watered.


"Speaker Boehner did not make this mess. I think it was forced upon him. He had to try to clean it up. He's the front person and he's here alone," Cohen told reporters. "They always say victory has a thousand allies, defeat is an orphan. And today, he was an orphan."


LAST-MINUTE PLANS ALWAYS BLOWING UP:The next year, as the tax provisions were again expiring, Boehner and House Republicans came to the brink of a "fiscal cliff." Claiming there had been bad faith on the president's part, Boehner walked away from the negotiations in favor of a Plan B -- only to have that blow up in his face, too.This would continually be a problem for Boehner. His fallback options were always a touch too cute. Like hereand here.


SHUTTING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT:In 2013, the government actually shut down, resulting in billions of dollars of economic damagefor which Republicans were blamed. Boehner had tried steadfastly to prevent it from happening. But in the end, he decided to let the conservatives in the caucus let out some steam first, which ended up costing the government $24 billion dollars or so.


NEARLY DEFAULTING ON THE DEBT: In the summer of 2011, Congress flirted with a debt ceiling crisis, and Boehner almost struck a "grand bargain" with President Barack Obama only to see it collapse in a cloud of recrimination. From that moment, however, we did get a few interesting items: a downgradeof the U.S. credit rating by Standards & Poor, the whole movement to "mint the coin!" and sequestration, which has reduced our deficit but also stymied economic growth and important things like biomedical research.


OBAMACARE THEATRICS:This pre-dated his time as speaker, but it's a signature Boehner moment of the Obama era. In a House floor speech during the 2010 Obamacare debate, Boehner famously bellowed, "Hell no you can't!" He was answering his own question about whether legislators could say the bill had been written openly.


(Boehner didn't mention that the bill hadwound its way through hearings and markups on no fewer than five different congressional committees.)




CREATING A BENGHAZI COMMITTEE:This could end up being his greatest legacy item from a Republican perspective. At the time, a Benghazi committee seemed totally superfluous, since many investigations had already been launched into the Sept. 11, 2011, attacks on the compound. Buts since then, the committee has uncovered Hillary Clinton's exclusive use of a private email account, which in turn is really cramping Clinton's plans to be the next president.


INVITING BIBI NETANYAHU TO ADDRESS CONGRESS:This is probably the polar inverse of the Benghazi committee. At the time, it looked like a crafty way to try to upend the president's Iran nuclear deal. But when the Israel prime minister addressed Congress, he only made the debate more of a partisan issue. Several Democrats have called it a turning point -- and not in a way that favored Boehner's goal of killing the accord.


SUING THE PRESIDENT -- NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE:Yes. Boehner grew litigious as his speakership went on. And not without some success. A court recently ruledthat the House of Representatives did have standing to sue the president over what Boehner claims have been unlawful, unilateral changes to Obamacare.


GETING TO SEE THE HOLY-SEE:Pope Francis addressing Congress this week gave Boehner one of his gladdest moments as speaker. He had tried to get a pope to come to the Capitol for 20 years, ever since he was a sophomore in 1994, and now it's a coda for his speakership.


What a day. What a moment for our country," Boehner said Thursday. "Im so proud that so many came to greet the Pope here at our Capitol, the worlds greatest symbol of democracy. The Holy Fathers visit is surely a blessing for all of us."Considering these factors and our cultural context together, it becomes clear that change will not come easily or quickly.  Yet, with thoughtful, specialized outreach, we can and should find ways to reach students during this psychologically and emotionally tumultuous time of their adult lives.

WASHINGTON -- If House Republicans get their way, cities and counties would either need to cooperate fully with immigration enforcement or lose federal grants for their police forces.


The House of Representatives approved a bill Thursday to block law enforcement grants to so-called sanctuary cities. The vote was 241 to 179, mostly along party lines.


The bill from Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) received a veto threat from the White House earlier in the day. But it's only one of many bills introduced in the House and Senate after the shooting of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco earlier this month. The undocumented immigrant man charged with her murder, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, had seven prior felony convictions and had been deported five times.


Lawmakers from both parties have said he should not have been on the streets and that something should be done to prevent those like him from being released. But Democrats, human rights groups and many mayors and law enforcement officialssay Republican proposals go too far -- potentiallypromoting unconstitutional detentions, threatening public safety and overstepping states' and localities' ability to set their own policies.




Many of the morethan 300 jurisdictions around the country that limit work with ICE agents, usually to a lesser degree than San Francisco, don't consider themselves "sanctuaries" at all, particularly since most partially cooperate. Officials in those jurisdictions argue their policiesprevent unconstitutional detention of people they have no warrant or judicial order to detain, and help ensure immigrants will come to them to report crimes.


Republicans say those arguments are bogus, and that there is blood on the hands of local officials and the Obama administration for allowing undocumented immigrants to go free.


"In my view, someone in this administration probably should be arrested for negligent homicide or for any of another dozen crimes that are so frequently committed by illegal immigrants in this country who shouldn't even be here," Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday.


Federal and local officials have been pointing fingers at each other over Lopez-Sanchez's release. He was most recently sentenced in May 2011 for illegal re-entry into the U.S. after being deported, and was in federal prison until March 2015. After he served his sentence, the Bureau of Prisons transferred Lopez-Sanchez to the San Francisco Sheriff's Department for a 20-year-old marijuana possession charge. When prosecutors declined to pursue that charge, he was released. San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said ICE should have taken steps to keep him in custody, but ICE officials say they were not notified that he was set to be released.


ICE officials have said this didn't need to happen. Under the Priority Enforcement Program, or PEP, a new policy meant to bring on board jurisdictions that limited cooperation with ICE,the agency asks local law enforcement for notificationbefore releasing certain people suspected of being undocumented.


Democrats have proposed making policy changes surrounding notifications to ICE or communication to prevent individuals like Lopez-Sanchez from being released. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said this week she is working on legislation that would require local law enforcement to inform ICE before making such releases. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) suggested that federal prisons should not release individuals to local law enforcement on warrants when there is a high likelihood those charges will be dropped, as happened for Lopez-Sanchez.


Tax-payers in other jurisdictions should not be punished for what happened in San Francisco, said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra. He represents Los Angeles, which limits its cooperation with ICE.


"This is not the way we do justice in America and it is wrong," he said on the House floor. "It is wrong for you to tell all these communities that have established a working relationship between their police officers and their growing immigrant communities that they're going to now lose funds to hire more police officers."


Republicans want to go beyond threatening federal law enforcement grants. Some bills would mandate a five-year minimum sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after being deported, and require local law enforcement to hold suspected undocumented immigrants based on ICE detainer requests regardless of qualms over constitutionality, cost or impact on policing.


Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said on the House floor Thursday that he received a commitment from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) that more immigration enforcement legislation will be brought to the floor.


He and other Republicans have cited figures that ICE released 30,558 convicted criminals in fiscal year 2014, 1,423 of whom went on to commit other crimes, as reasons that additional immigration reform laws are needed.


Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and ICE Director Sarah Saldaa have said that mandating detainers would be counter-productive, although they said they want local law enforcement to work with them. That's the goal of PEP, and 33 of the 49 priority jurisdictions have already signed on, according to Johnson and Saldaa.


In the veto threat, administration officials said Hunter's bill would harm those efforts.


"The Congress should give PEP a chance to work, instead of displacing that collaborative approach -- which prioritizes the worst offenders -- with the coercive approach of this bill, which makes no such differentiation," the statement of policy reads.

Pubblichiamo la traduzione integrale dell'intervista al segretario di Stato americano John Kerry apparsa venerd 4 settembre sull'edizione Usa dell'Huffington Post. Dall'accordo sul nucleare iraniano alla situazione israelo-palestinese, dalla crisi europea dei profughi al disgelo con Cuba. Il ministro degli Esteri di Barack Obama a tutto campo.SAM STEIN: Innanzitutto grazie per essere qui con noi, la cosa mi fa molto piacere. JOHN KERRY: Lieto di essere qui.STEIN:  ormai cosa nota che laccordo con lIran riuscir a superare il passaggio dal Congresso. Ma circa la met del Paese si dichiara contraria ad esso, e praticamente ogni candidato repubblicano alle presidenziali sostiene che lo straccer non appena verr eletto. Quindi quanto si pu dire che sia solido, in realt, questo accordo?

KERRY: Beh, prima di tutto  stata spesa unenorme quantit di denaro si  scatenato un tremendo bombardamento fatto di rappresentazioni distorte, e di vere e proprie, per cos dire, non-verit  credo che sia questa la parola che adoperer  su che cosa preveda in realt questo accordo, e sul come. Alla luce di tutto questo non mi sento poi cos sorpreso dal fatto che alcuni sondaggi mostrino una simile inclinazione.STEIN: Certo. KERRY: Ma il fatto  che tanti sondaggi dimostrano che in realt il Paese lo sostiene, e che le due diverse opinioni sono piuttosto bilanciate. Sono convinto che si tratti di un risultato niente male, tenendo conto della quantit di denaro che  stata spesa per diffondere delle leggende.Con tutto il rispetto per i candidati alle presidenziali, e per ci che stanno dicendo oggi, ascolta  se in Iran distruggeranno il nocciolo di plutonio del reattore di Arak, ricoprendolo di cemento, cos che esso cesser di esistere, e se ad Arak verranno smantellati i due terzi delle centrifughe, interrompendo larricchimento, se si abbasser il livello delle scorte a trecento chilogrammi, portando larricchimento solo fino al 3,67 per cento, e se alla fine sar stato fatto tutto ci che avevano detto che avrebbero fatto per tenere fede allaccordo laddove poi arrivasse un nuovo presidente a dire: Beh, adesso invece io  questo sarebbe assurdo.A quel punto infatti, il Paese sar daccordo al 90 per cento, perch avranno potuto osservare che in realt avr funzionato, eliminando cos la minaccia di unarma nucleare in Medio Oriente.STEIN: Quindi tu sei convinto che si tratti perlopi di chiacchiere prive di fondamento?KERRY: No, Sam, in realt credo che quelle che vengono poste siano domande pi che lecite. STEIN: Mi riferisco in particolare ai candidati che sostengono che lo straccerebbero. Mi sembri convinto che la cosa sia quasi impraticabile.

KERRY: Beh, guarda, non me ne star qui a sindacare su che cosa lo sia o non lo sia, mi limito a presentarti il mio punto di vista sulla realt dei fatti quando verr eletto un nuovo presidente.Proprio non riesco a figurarmelo un presidente disposto a presentarsi alle Nazioni Unite, di fronte agli altri cinque Paesi che ci hanno sostenuto per la durata di questo negoziato, e ad andare a dire loro: Scusateci, ma adesso ci tiriamo indietro, finendo col creare una situazione ancor pi pericolosa in Medio Oriente. Semplicemente, non me lo immagino.STEIN: Per quanto mi riguarda una delle critiche pi convincenti nei confronti dellaccordo  che col passar del tempo, quando lIran avr potuto godere del sollevamento delle sanzioni, laggi finiremo per ritrovarci un po con le mani legate. E con questo, insomma, voglio dire che non saremo pi liberi di andare a intervenire sullinstabilit della regione, sul finanziamento del terrorismo, perch a quel punto si gireranno verso di noi e ci verranno a dire: Beh, cos voi state violando lo spirito dellaccordo, e allora potrebbero tirarsi indietro. Come risponderesti a questa critica?KERRY: Alla critica rispondo facendo notare che questo accordo ha dei contorni molto ben precisamente formulati,  stato studiato paragrafo per paragrafo, e qualsiasi aspettativa  stata posta nero su bianco proprio perch non volevamo nulla che fosse improntato sulla fiducia, o sulla speranza. La natura di questo accordo  molto specifica riguardo a ci che chiede di fare ai propri contraenti. E se in Iran, dopo un certo numero di anni, si supereranno alcune delle restrizioni pi forti che abbiamo negoziato per un certo periodo di tempo, sar solo per creare un po di serenit riguardo alla natura del loro programma. Sar per permettere laccesso agli ispettori. Sar per poterci accertare che in effetti lattuazione del programma segua un percorso efficiente e affidabile.E anche dopo quel periodo di quindici anni quando poi dun tratto No, non dun tratto, ma una volta che ci si sar assicurati delleffettiva riduzione delle scorte, per dirne una  sussister comunque il requisito dellassoluta libert daccesso per ispezionare un qualsiasi impianto, ovunque si sospetti che potrebbero essere impegnati in una qualche attivit di natura illecita.Inoltre per ventanni la produzione dei loro mantici e turbine, ossia i pezzi pi importanti delle loro centrifughe, verr seguita dalle telecamere. E, cosa particolarmente significativa  per la prima volta nella storia degli accordi sugli armamenti  per venticinque anni si potr seguire la loro produzione delluranio, dalla miniera fino alla tomba.STEIN: Ma il dubbio qui  che loro potrebbero non agire in buona fede. Che potrebbero approfittare del momento in cui gli Stati Uniti andranno a stringere sui finanziamenti al terrorismo, e dire: Sapete che c?.KERRY:  un problema loro. Se mai lo facessero, sarebbe un problema loro, perch noi li chiameremo a tener fede a questo accordo, e se mai lo violassero, o se in un qualsiasi momento ci dessero motivo di sospettare che stiano lavorando a unarma nucleare, noi avremmo tutte le opzioni che abbiamo a disposizione anche oggi. STEIN: Ovviamente tu nei stato architetto, e con tutta probabilit sei anche il pi acceso sostenitore dellaccordo. Sono curioso, qual  la tua principale preoccupazione, nello specifico, riguardo alla sua applicazione?KERRY: Beh credo che una preoccupazione naturale da avere sarebbe quella che in Iran ci siano delle frange che possano fare resistenza, o che si rifiutino di fare qualcosa. Nel qual caso il governo iraniano verr chiamato a risponderne.Quindi, s, la vedo la possibilit di un intoppo qui o l, e che ci si possa effettivamente trovare ad affrontare qualcosa di simile, ma non riesco a figurarmi che il governo, arrivati a questo punto, si possa mettere in condizione di rischiare tutte queste sanzioni, e ovviamente un possibile intervento militare  laddove si trattasse dellunica opzione disponibile.STEIN: Lamministrazione ha alluso, o sostanzialmente dichiarato di voler lavorare insieme ai Paesi del Golfo e a Israele per accrescere il livello della sicurezza nazionale e dei propri meccanismi di difesa, proprio alla luce di tutto questo. In sostanza, in che modo lintroduzione di altre armi nella regione potr essere in grado di contribuire a stabilizzarla?KERRY: Beh, si tratta di armi di difesa. Sono armi che permetteranno a questi Paesi di difendersi, e questo  un aspetto molto importante della deterrenza. Ma da molti punti di vista tutto ci lavremmo fatto comunque, indipendentemente dallaccordo, perch le attivit dellIran nei confronti di Hezbollah, le armi che passa alla milizia sciita irachena, le armi che passa agli Huthi e altrove, sono tutte questioni profondamente inquietanti. Avvengono in violazione dellembargo, e dovremmo opporci ad esse in qualsiasi circostanza.Perci sono convinto che quello che ci ritroveremo fra le mani qui sar un eccezionale nuovo progetto in fase di sviluppo per la sicurezza della regione, che vedr Israele e i Paesi arabi uniti da uninedita causa comune, nel farsi scudo da questo genere dattivit iraniane.STEIN: Sarebbe piuttosto inedita come causa comune.KERRY: Sar senza dubbio inedita, ma al momento  ancora tutto perlopi da definire.STEIN: Ma gli israeliani lhanno manifestata la loro disponibilit a collaborare coi Paesi del Golfo, che per tradizione non sono mai stati esattamente in ottimi rapporti con Israele?KERRY: Credo che si possa dire che se oggi ad esempio si guarda allEgitto Insomma, la risposta  che sta gi accadendo. Insomma, Giordania ed Egitto stanno gi cooperando con Israele sul Sinai e sullo jihadismo nella regione, e sarei propenso ad aspettarmi che ci vada avanti, e che sintensifichi perfino.STEIN: Probabilmente si tratter di uniper-semplificazione, ma da alcuni punti di vista pare che sia in atto una specie di scambio: stiamo mettendo in conto il rischio di conflitti regionali dalle dimensioni pi contenute per ridurre la probabilit di un conflitto dalla portata pi ampia e cataclismatica.KERRY: Io non la vedo affatto cos. Ci che stiamo cercando di fare  render chiaro allIran che se vorr entrare a far parte della comunit internazionale ed essere un Paese dal buon nome, impegnandosi per la pace e per la stabilit senza appoggiare sostituti e delegati, la strada c. Ma se al contrario lIran vorr continuare a seguire i propri metodi, ci ritroveremo uniti nei nostri sforzi per impedire quella destabilizzazione, e opporci a quel genere dattivit. STEIN: Il presidente ha sostenuto KERRY: E potrei aggiungere, c una cosa molto importante, Sam  sono sicuro che ne sei consapevole, con Daesh, lISIL, laggi  esiste un fattore unificante per molti Paesi della regione, che per inciso includono lIran. STEIN: S, ci volevo arrivare.KERRY: Perch lIran , significativamente, contrario alle loro attivit. STEIN: Prima di arrivarci, per  il presidente ha sostenuto che oggi quelle stesse persone che hanno votato a favore della guerra in Iraq, nellopporsi a questo accordo stanno sostanzialmente incitando a una guerra con lIran. Lei ha votato per la guerra in Iraq. E quindi mi chiedo in quale modo quel voto abbia influenzato il suo punto di vista su questo accordo.KERRY: Beh, lasciami chiarire. Se hai letto il mio discorso, cosa che tinvito a fare, quello che ho pronunciato in aula per spiegare il significato del mio voto, io non avevo votato affinch si andasse in guerra. Avevo votato per fornire al presidente lo strumento necessario a ricorrere a tutte le soluzioni alternative a lui disponibili per riuscire a convincere Saddam Hussein ad adottare il comportamento che volevamo.STEIN: Bene, lasciami riformulare la domanda.

KERRY: Ma non  successo. STEIN: Certo.KERRY: E me ne rammarico. E infatti mi rammaricai di quel voto, perch sono convinto che se ne abus. Al contrario di quanto ci era stato promesso in merito al ricorso a tutte le soluzioni alternative, mi resi conto che cera stato un impeto belligerante. Quindi si  trattato di un pessimo voto. Ed  cos che stanno le cose.Ma  molto diverso da ci di cui stiamo parlando oggi, perch sono convinto che nel caso dellIran siano tutti daccordo nel non volere che ottenga unarma nucleare. Lunica questione  il modo migliore per impedire che ci accada. Siamo convinti che ottenere questo accordo coi suoi requisiti decennali, a quindici, a venti, a venticinque anni, e quelli a vita che dovranno rispettare per protocollo aggiuntivo, garantendo laccesso agli ispettori   una conquista di gran lunga pi preziosa e importante di quanto non lo sia votare no, e ritrovarsi poi con niente in mano. Nessuna restrizione. Nessuna ispezione. Nessuna sanzione, perdendo al contempo lunit dei P5+1 e del resto del mondo, cosa che  stata ottenuta a fatica.STEIN: Quindi quando siamo corsi a far la guerra non si pu dire che ci sia stato alcun nobile intento dinsistere sulla strada diplomatica oltre il 2002.

KERRY: No, al contrario. Credo profondamente, e ho sempre creduto  ed era quello il punto, ecco perch dico di andarti a rileggere ci che ho detto in aula al Senato. STEIN: Lo far.KERRY: Credo che si debba prima ricorrere a tutte le alternative. E noi, infatti, non abbiamo mai voluto dare lautorizzazione a partire, non abbiamo mai detto va bene, andiamo a fare una guerra per nostra scelta. La guerra non dovrebbe mai essere una guerra per scelta, dovrebbe essere una guerra di necessit. E dovrebbe trattarsi dellultima risorsa. Questo  ci che mi ha sempre animato.Ecco perch a mio giudizio, in questo caso, eravamo tenuti a tentare fino allultimo una soluzione diplomatica con lIran, prima di avviarci lungo una strada che avrebbe inevitabilmente portato verso il conflitto. STEIN: Di recente hai riferito a Jeffrey Goldberg sullAtlantic che il primo ministro iraniano Zarif ha dichiarato che non appena questaccordo verr siglato avr lautorit per lavorare al tuo fianco, discutendo dei problemi della regione. Avete gi cominciato a parlarne?KERRY: No, non ancora. Laccordo non  ancora fatto. Dobbiamo concluderlo. STEIN: Che cosa prevedi Questo mi sembra un ottimo punto: evidentemente il trentaquattresimo voto non era lultimo pezzo mancante  ma di che cosa supponi che si parler, nel corso di quei colloqui?KERRY: Si parler della regione.STEIN: Niente di pi specifico?KERRY: Di ci che sta accadendo in Siria, in particolare. Beh, della Siria, in particolare. Penso che, insomma, le morti in Siria siano un affronto per chiunque, per qualunque Paese aspiri alla decenza e alla legalit.  una catastrofe di portata critica per la regione, per tutti noi. Aumenta la pressione sulle spalle della Giordania, del Libano, della Turchia. Oggi nel Paese ci sono circa otto milioni di sfollati. E quattro milioni di rifugiati fuori dai suoi confini. Sono orgoglioso di poter affermare che oggi siamo quelli che pi hanno contribuito con le nostre donazioni alla crisi dei rifugiati. Ma preferirei che potessimo smetterla di fare donazioni per la crisi dei rifugiati e che cominciassimo piuttosto a veder tutte quelle persone libere di tornare a casa. STEIN: Pensi che ci siano gli elementi necessari a una possibile collaborazione con la leadership iraniana per ottenere una risoluzione diplomatica? KERRY: Non labbiamo ancora analizzato, Sam, ovviamente. Ma lIran odia lISIL, e anche noi. LISIL  un pericolo. Nel ventunesimo secolo, dopo tutto ci che abbiamo passato,  una contraddizione talmente sbalorditiva quella di assistere a un gruppo che se ne va a distruggere templi, a decapitare persone che vorrebbero proteggerli, e a riconoscere nello stupro uno strumento di guerra e di legittimazione del proprio popolo, nel modo pi disonorevole.Dobbiamo fare qualcosa a riguardo  di pi, onestamente. E penso che con la crisi dei migranti in Europa il mondo stia cominciando a svegliarsi, e a rendersi conto che va fatto di pi.STEIN: Bene, allora parliamo della crisi dei migranti. Sta diventando un problema sempre pi urgente, questanno, quello dei rifugiati.KERRY: Molto urgente.STEIN: C qualcosa che potremmo fare in pi per aiutare lEuropa ad affrontarla? O per aiutare i Paesi del Golfo ad affrontarla? Che cosa possiamo fare per

KERRY: Beh, secondo me se c una cosa che tutto ci va ad evidenziare  la necessit di andare ad affrontare le questioni a monte. Questo genere di esodi di massa di esseri umani bisogna cercare di prevenirli.STEIN: Ma a parte una soluzione alla guerra civile in Siria, che certo non si raggiunger domani, che cosa potremmo fare nellimmediato futuro?KERRY: No, certo, ma potremmo fare molto di pi per proteggere queste persone. Ovviamente bisognerebbe creare una struttura che permetta loro di non vivere nella disperazione. Bisogna fornire degli alloggi temporanei, e garantire la possibilit di nutrirsi.STEIN: Potremmo forse ospitarne di pi? Voglio dire, la Germania ne sta accogliendo ottocentomila.KERRY: Beh, non parlo di un qualcosa di permanente. Abbiamo giganteschi campi per rifugiati in Giordania e in Libano. Abbiamo dei campi per rifugiati in Turchia. Per affrontare la situazione potremmo trovarci a dover organizzare una qualche struttura temporanea per rifugiati. Ma sono convinto Spero che per tanti Paesi tutto ci faccia soprattutto sentire il richiamo alla necessit di concentrarsi maggiormente sul problema di fondo.STEIN: Per caso hai visto quella foto del bambino siriano di tre anni?KERRY: Certo. Certo.STEIN: Che cosa hai pensato?KERRY: Insomma,  una foto scioccante e provocatoria, da molti punti di vista. Io ho un nipote di quellet. Ecco a che cosa si pensa. STEIN: Siamo quasi al primo anniversario della dichiarazione di guerra che il presidente ha lanciato allo Stato Islamico. Di recente si  letto che alcuni dossier dellintelligence militare sarebbero stati sostanzialmente manipolati o alleggeriti nei toni per, non saprei, magari influenzare i legislatori, o forse nascondere la verit sulla situazione della campagna contro lo Stato Islamico. Ne hai sentito parlare?KERRY: Dossier militari, e?STEIN: Della questione mi risulta che se ne stia occupando linspector general del Pentagono. Si legge che questi dossier dellintelligence [presenterebbero] la situazione della campagna che stiamo conducendo contro lo Stato Islamico in modo pi roseo di quanto essa non stia andando in realt. Hai letto qualcosa in proposito?KERRY: Non ho letto niente a riguardo. No. Mi risulta nuovo. Ma non penso che qualcuno mi abbia addolcito la pillola. Siamo consapevoli di quanto grande sia questa sfida. Credo che per alcuni versi stia andando meglio in alcuni luoghi. E in altri invece no. Ma ci che mi pare chiaro  che per distruggere lISIL bisogna fare di pi. STEIN: Come descriveresti i nostri progressi, dopo un anno?KERRY: Penso che in alcuni luoghi di progressi ne abbiamo fatti. Abbiamo visto rientrare centomila persone a Tikrit. Sunniti ai quali  stato possibile tornare nelle proprie case, che erano state occupate dallISIL. Abbiamo avviato il nostro impegno a Ramadi, la nostra campagna, e labbiamo vista iniziare a ottenere dei progressi concreti. Le trib sunnite stanno cominciando a partecipare, e a combattere.Ma c tanto altro da fare. Mosul resta sotto il loro controllo. Nella parte curda del Paese abbiamo potuto osservare una resistenza significativa, una resistenza francamente pi competente, contro lISIL. Nella zona settentrionale della Siria mi pare che di recente qualche progresso sia stato fatto. Ma c ancora troppa gente che riesce a filtrare, a passare, troppe reclute, troppa sostenibilit per qualcosa che non dovrebbe essere affatto sostenibile. STEIN: Guardando un po in avanti: insomma, hai portato a casa laccordo con lIran, hai chiuso quello con Cuba  qual  il prossimo obiettivo sulla tua lista delle cose da fare prima di lasciare lincarico? KERRY: Beh, dovremo provare a vedere se a Parigi si riuscir a ottenere un accordo sui cambiamenti climatici. Questa  una priorit molto, molto importante per noi. Ci stiamo lavorando molto duramente.  per questo che sono andato in Alaska, e abbiamo avuto tutti quegli incontri cogli altri ministri degli esteri.Tutto inizi quando andai in Cina due anni fa, e cominciammo a predisporre il terreno per la partecipazione della Cina a un accordo dalla portata storica. Auspicabilmente la cosa culminer in un qualche risultato a Parigi. Insomma,  una questione davvero determinante. STEIN: Ti volevo chiedere qualcosa in proposito. Allora, il dibattito  il seguente: nel tuo primo discorso di fronte allArctic Council hai parlato della prospettiva di fonti energetiche pulite nellArtico. Ma la prima azione compiuta dagli Stati Uniti, non appena seduti sulla poltrona della presidenza dellArctic Council,  stata sostanzialmente quella di autorizzare la Shell ad effettuare delle trivellazioni esplorative al largo della costa alaskana. In questo caso il messaggio che passa non  un po confuso?KERRY: In realt no, perch si trattava di concessioni autorizzate gi qualche anno fa, prima che il presidente Obama venisse eletto. Quindi le concessioni esistevano gi, e nel corso dei prossimi anni la Shell e le altre andranno quindi ad effettuare delle trivellazioni. Anche perch di certo non riusciremo a svezzarci dal petrolio tutto in una volta. Inoltre si tratta di un petrolio pi pulito di altri, e credo che riguardo al nostro impegno a muoverci in direzione di uneconomia de-carbonizzata, ci vorranno venti, trenta, quarantanni, quindi non  qualcosa che andr subito via. STEIN: Insomma, non  che possiamo aspettarci di smettere da un giorno allaltro. KERRY: S, ma non  solo questo. Il fatto  che comunque preferirei che il nostro fabbisogno provenisse da una fonte sotto controllo americano, piuttosto che da altrove.Ma nel lungo periodo dovremo svezzarci dalleconomia a base di carbonio. Dobbiamo assolutamente farlo. Dovremo farlo pi in fretta di quanto non stiamo gi facendo. Credo che questo al presidente sia chiaro, e a me  chiaro. Stiamo spingendo con tutta la forza che abbiamo. E al presidente, sfortunatamente  a causa della riluttanza a crederci mostrata da alcuni membri del Congresso  tocca muoversi per provvedimenti amministrativi.STEIN: Che poi finiscono presi di mira in aula al Senato. KERRY: Gli tocca muoversi per provvedimenti amministrativi, cosa che lo rende molto difficile.STEIN: E qui siamo arrivati alla parte della trasmissione dedicata alla politica interna, a quanto pare.KERRY: Ah, s? STEIN: Oh, s, ci siamo arrivati. Giusto qualche domanda.Ci sono degli impiegati governativi che hanno passato informazioni e che oggi si ritrovano in galera per aver fatto, a volte anche inavvertitamente, uso improprio di informazioni secretate. Ma del tema delliper-secretazione ne stiamo sentendo parlare solo oggi dai democratici e da qualcun altro, dato che lex segretario di stato Hillary Clinton ha avuto dei problemi con le sue email. Non si pu forse dire che ci siano stati due pesi e due misure, visto che della questione prima non ci importava pi di tantoKERRY: No, e qui sta la differenza, Sam, sono convinto che sia una differenza concreta, e penso che la gente dovrebbe prestarvi particolare attenzione.Prima di tutto voglio dire che mi asterr dallentrare nel merito della questione, e mi limiter a trattarla in maniera generica, perch ci sono delle indagini in corso. La mia responsabilit  quella di produrre quelle mail il pi rapidamente possibile, cos che la gente possa formarsi la propria opinione. Ma una delle impressioni che ci si pu gi fare finora  che non esista alcuna prova che sia mai stato trasmesso qualcosa che allepoca era stato secretato. Ecco ci di cui si sta parlando. Fare la spia  qualcosa che riguarda informazioni secretate. Ma se linformazione in questione  arrivata sul Blackberry di qualcuno, o sulla posta elettronica di qualcuno, e non era secretata, per poi  stata successivamente secretata allinterno del sistema,  tutta unaltra questione.STEIN: Tu ti sei trovato da entrambi i lati della barricata  dal legislativo allesecutivo. In generale pensi che da noi si tenda a iper-secretare?KERRY: S.STEIN: Allora che cosa dovremmo fare a riguardo?KERRY: Beh,  complicato perch, insomma, di iperclassificazione se ne fa in dosi massicce. La gente si limita ad apporvi in tutta fretta il timbro, perch cos in un certo senso avrai sempre ragione nel caso in cui qualcuno dopo venga a sindacare. Ergo, nel dubbio, la cosa pi facile  secretare e archiviare.STEIN:  stata coniata anche una sigla, PIC, che magari non  lideale davanti alle telecamere: Parati il culo.KERY: Noi siamo Ho avviato una riforma del dipartimento, e ho scritto personalmente allinspector general per invitarlo ad analizzare lintero processo, cos da permetterci di avere allinterno del nostro sistema il maggiore livello possibile di responsabilit e di insight.E siamo preparati bisogna rendersi conto che tutto questo fenomeno delle email, ovviamente, si  sviluppato solo negli ultimi anni, e che il sistema ha bisogno di essere aggiornato: come affrontare la questione nella maniera appropriata? Come gestire questa mole di dati?STEIN: Un paio di ultime domande veloci. Detto solo fra noi e le telecamere: tu ti candiderai, vero?KERRY: Com piccolo il mondo.STEIN: Piccolo, no?KERRY: Lo so che sai come tenere un segreto. STEIN: Ovviamente. Non ci sentir nessuno, no? Saresti interessato a candidarti alla presidenza?KERRY: Io non mi candider.STEIN: Perch no?KERRY: Al momento non  nelle cose. Mi piace il lavoro che sto facendo,  ricco di grandi sfide, ho unagenda piena dimpegni da portare avanti nel corso dei prossimi mesi Parigi, per esempio. Sono anni che lavoro alla questione dei cambiamenti climatici, da quando ero al Senato.STEIN:  un lavoro pi divertente che candidarsi alla presidenza. KERRY: Non necessariamente, ma significa portare a termine qualcosa. E per me  questo che conta oggi. STEIN: Ti far unaltra domanda molto pi controversa di quella sulla tua candidatura. Tom Brady ora  un uomo libero, e pu tornare a giocare a football. KERRY: Fantastico.STEIN: Giustizia  stata fatta o negata?

KERRY: (Ride) Vuoi un mio commento?STEIN: S, vorrei un tuo commento.  KERRY: Ma tu sei un bravo tifoso dei Red Sox?STEIN: S, io tifo per i Red Sox, ma anche per i Giants. Mi colloco in quella terra di mezzo del Connecticut.

KERRY: Grosso errore.  unambivalenza del tutto inspiegabile. Davvero. STEIN: Lo so, lo so. Me lo sono gi sentito dire da altri membri della redazione. STEIN: Quindi sei contento che quella sospensione sia stata ritirata?KERRY: Ne sono estasiato. Entusiasta. E non vedo loro di vedere Tom Brady e i Patriots contro Pittsburg il dieci.STEIN: Allinterno di questo edificio adesso hanno aperto un Dunkin Donuts: ottime notizie per uno del New England come te.KERRY: Fantastico. Era ora. STEIN: Grazie mille, signor segretario. Lho apprezzato davvero.Traduzione di Stefano PitrelliLeggi il testo originale dell'intervista di Sam Stein a John Kerry pubblicato su Huffington Post Usa

                    11.09.2015

                        Cada perro tiene su da, y para esta dulce perrita, ya era hora.

Bretagne, una golden retriever, es una de las ltimas sobrevivientes...                    An old "Sesame Street" clip making its rounds on the Internet is further proving the show's longevity.


The educational show for kids is still around, but a scene from years ago has recently gained some popularity on Viral Thread's Facebook page. The video features Herry Monster counting to 20 with a boy he calls John John, and has been viewed more than 10 million times since being posted on July 8.


As soon as little John John lays down the law with Herry Monster and says, "I go first, you go second," we knew we were in for a treat.




According to The New York Times, John John was 2 years old when he made his "Sesame Street" debut in 1971. He went on to do more skits with other beloved "Sesame Street" charactersas a kid and reunited with his pals to make an appearance as an adult in the 1989 TV special "Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting"and recreate his adorable scene with Herry. He gave his furry friend a quick update on his life, shared that he went by John Williams now and of course let him know that he'd count first and Herry could go second.


WASHINGTON -- Though there were some bumps, leading Republican presidential candidates in the past week settled on an Iraq war narrative. Yes, the intelligence turned out to be faulty, so much so that there wouldn't be a strong enough case to authorize the invasion in retrospect. But there was consensus that at the time President George W. Bush made the call, something had to be done about the threat posed by Iraq. For those lawmakers who actually voted against the war, and those journalists who reported skeptically before the attack, this is misleading at best and self-serving at worst. Watching the revisionist story take hold 13 years after they opposed the invasion is reviving the frustration and marginalization they felt back then."I was amazed, absolutely amazed at how people were supporting going to war on the basis of things that just werent so," said former Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), one of a handful of members who opposed the invasion. "It was clear as it could be. Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. None of the intel suggested they had anything to do with 9/11 and the whole rationale for WMD [weapons of mass destruction] was just very, very thin for anybody who read the intelligence reports." As for the 2016 candidates' comments, he said: "It is just a rewriting of history in an attempt for everybody to cover their extraordinary mistake; probably one of the most serious mistakes in the military and diplomatic history of the United States, and they were all complicit."Presidential campaigns don't lend themselves to nuanced discussions. But the conversation over the origins of the Iraq war, to the war's initial detractors, has been particularly narrow. Asking candidates whether they would have authorized the invasion knowing what they know now tripped up former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who stumbled for days with the question. But it has revealed little about the foreign policy world views of the other candidates.  The more interesting question, war skeptics said, is what the candidates would have done during the months when the invasion was being debated -- a time when airing doubts about the intelligence or the motives of the Bush administration carried political risk."I have to say, not being privy to intelligence briefings as others were, I probably had the benefit of objectivity," former Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), a war critic, told The Huffington Post. "That is to say, I wasn't being misled by intelligence briefings by the administration or anyone else. But it didn't pass the smell test. And, to be honest with you, I didn't trust the people promoting the war in Iraq. I knew many of them and thought they had a different agenda. They had in mind to use Iraq as an American political and military base in the Middle East and reach out from there to impose peace on the region. It was a grand scheme, but many bridges too far." To hear many former and current supporters of the war tell it now, there was remarkably little dissent at the time of the invasion. The case that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction was shared not just by Democrats and Republicans, but by other countries and by previous U.S. administrations, they say. Bush adopted these widely shared conclusions and launched a well-intentioned war based on bad intelligence. Subsequent reporting complicates this narrative. Immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Bush administration began considering striking Iraq and sought to link Saddam Hussein with al Qaeda. The administration dismissed concerns about the reliability of certain intelligence, and suppressed information that cast doubt on Iraq's weapons programs. Former Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) who served as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, would later accuse the White House of a systematic effort to dupe Congress that was so thorough that it irrevocably damaged Congress' trust in the executive office and compelled him to oppose the war authorization. Major news outlets didn't help. Many played a role in selling the war by amplifying bogus claims of an Iraq-al Qaeda link, along with the faulty WMD intelligence. McClatchy newspapers national security correspondent Jonathan Landay, who was part of the reporting team providing a skeptical counterpoint to the media drumbeat, noted the Bush administration created a parallel intelligence operation that included the Office of Special Plans in the Pentagon. That office selectively strung together intelligence that contradicted the CIAs correct assessment at the time that there was no link between Hussein and al Qaeda. That messy history is mostly lost in the simplistic, knowing-what-we-know-now conversation.What was driving a lot of this was the politics, not the intelligence, Landay said in an interview on Monday. It was the Bush administrations promotion of an invasion based on bogus and exaggerated intelligence that created a political bandwagon, which it was intended to do, for popular support for the invasion.The medias revisiting of the Iraq war through the lens of the 2016 election comes at an incredibly fragile time for the country. The Islamic State took control of the major Iraq city of Ramadi on Sunday, sparking renewed debate over America's role in the region. Landay suggested journalists focus on whats happening now on the ground, rather than what politicians think about a 13-year-old vote. Why are we asking hypotheticals? he said. Part of why Landay and others find the hypothetical so irksome is that it absolves politicians and the press of addressing the nitty-gritty of why the country went to war. It also asks those running for the White House to place themselves in Bushs shoes without context, from the manipulation of intelligence to the real-time opposition to the invasion. Bill Moyers, whose 2007 documentary "Buying the War" charged the press with falling down on the job in not scrutinizing the Bush administrations claims, said in an email to HuffPost that Washington is marked by what the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz called a refusal to remember.Moyers suggested that many in the Washington press corps wont seriously examine how prescient Iraq war critics were back then, because it would require them to be somewhere else on the night of the Gridiron than sitting by their sources from the Bush era. As a result, he said, recent coverage of whether to invade bears little relation to the past and less understanding of its implications.There were 133 members of the House who opposed the war authorization, along with 23 senators. The current Democratic frontrunner for president, Hillary Clinton, was not among them. Hart said he believes that further prevents a more illuminating discussion about the war's origins. Still, he said he sees Clinton as one of the few candidates capable of the job of president. And it's precisely the run-up to the Iraq war that illuminates her qualification, he said.  After Iraq, Hart said, "we should insist that any candidate who wants to be president have some familiarity with the intelligence community. Presidents have to be smart enough to know what questions to ask, not just of the CIA, but of defense intelligence and other organization. You can't hire that. ... You have to get inside the mentality of that community and how it thinks and how it operates."Hart acknowledged that his standard would prevent most governors from serving. So be it. "It means that those who decide when they are 11 years old that they want to be president ought to think about things like this instead of how to glad-hand and raise money," he said.


Y luego nos preguntamos por qu ya nadie cree en el boxeo.El peleador britnico Tyson Fury mont este mircoles uno de los espectculos ms patticos que se han visto en la promocin de una contienda por el ttulo mundial. Se present disfrazado de Batman a la conferencia de prensa en Londres y golpe a un supuesto Joker que hizo comparsa, ante la incredulidad de los medios de comunicacin presentes."As es como vas a quedar t cuando te enfrente el 24 de octubre. l es un tonto, as como t", dijo Fury a Wladimir Klitschko, actual campen de peso completo.El monarca ucraniano se limit a observar el "show" y calific de "payaso" a su prximo rival, al que prometi noquear en el combate que tendr lugar en Duesseldorf, Alemania.Fury tendr que emular al Batman de las tiras cmicas si quiere destronar al campen, invicto desde hace 11 aos en 22 peleas y con una foja de 64 victorias por solo tres derrotas.A decir de los expertos, la divisin de los pesos completos lleva aos deslucida y carente del brillo que le dieron en alguna poca figuras de la talla de Muhammad Ali, Joe Fraizer, Mike Tyson o Evander Holyfield. Parece que ni Batman podr rescatarla.


Elizabeth Gutirrez est enamorada, mejor dicho, enamoradsima de un galn que la tiene loca desde hace 9 aos --y no es William Levy.Se trata de su hijo mayor, Christopher, de quien se siente tan orgullosa que no deja de compartir tiernas fotos en su cuenta de Instagram.Ayer nos sorprendi con esta bella imagen de madre e hijo dndose un beso lleno de ternura, y con un mensaje muy amoroso.Elizabeth es muy unida a sus hijos, y aunque ahora se encuentra todos los fines de semana protagonizando la obra de teatro "Brujas" en Miami, casi todo su tiempo se lo dedica a Tophy y Kailey, tanto que ha decidido rechazar telenovelas y pelculas para no estar lejos de ellos en esta etapa tan importante de su crecimiento.MIRA OTAS FOTOS QUE ELIZABETH COMPARTI EN INSTAGRAM:


Con dos goles de Omar Bravo y una falla arbitral clave, el conjunto de Chivas dio la sorpresa al llevarse el clsico del futbol mexicano, luego de vencer en el estadio Azteca 2-1 al Amrica, que no pudo aprovechar el jugar con un hombre ms durante poco ms de medio tiempo, luego de la expulsin de Carlos Salcido.El encuentro fue bien jugado por ambos conjuntos desde el comienzo, donde Amrica rpidamente se hizo de la pelota, pero gracias al buen planteamiento del cuadro rival no pudo hacer nada, pues se qued sin ideas para abrir el candado enemigo.Chivas sigui sin arriesgar mucho, pero abri el marcador al aprovechar una falla de Oswaldo Martnez, quien regres un baln a su zaga de mala manera, donde Omar Bravo se aviv y le gan la pelota tanto a defensores como al portero para solamente mandarla al fondo.Con el gol en contra Amrica no cambi, sigui presionando pero sin tener claridad al frente, por lo que el tiempo se le fue escapando; sin embargo, Chivas al 39 en una gran jugada colectiva logr incrementar su ventaja mediante un testarazo de Omar Bravo, luego de un excelente centro de Ral Lpez.Cuando se pensaba que el primer tiempo terminara con la doble ventaja rojiblanca, Carlos Darwin Quintero logr meterse al rea y, al momento de fusilar al portero, Carlos Salcido lo trab, por lo que el silbante lo expuls y marc penal al 41'. Oswaldo Martnez acort las distancias con fuerte disparo.Para la parte complementaria, Amrica, con el hombre ms en el terreno de juego, se le fue encima a Chivas, mas la escuadra jalisciense se acomod mejor en su zona defensiva y rompi todo intento americanista, que se volvi a quedar sin variantes para atacar.Faltando 20 minutos para la finalizacin del cotejo, por fin Amrica lleg con peligro, pero el zaguero Jair Pereira salv en la raya final su meta, luego de un cabezazo dentro del rea chica, donde el defensor rojiblanco se lanz de palomita para reventar la pelota.Pero la controversia arbitral lleg al final del cotejo, luego de que el silbante le anul un gol legtimo a la escuadra americanista por conducto de Oribe Peralta, quien logr conectar un baln de cabeza en buena posicin, pero el abanderado levant su bandera equivocadamente, por lo que de este modo qued sentenciado el marcador a favor del cuadro de Chivas.



   ASSOCIATED PRESS Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has vehemently opposed EU quota plans to relocate refugees across Europe.   As European leaders meet Wednesday for an emergency summit on the region's urgent migrant and refugee crisis, the man to watch is Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.


The populist prime minister has been one of the most prominent political voices arguing for Europe to fortify its borders, in a year that has seenhundreds of thousands of peoplejourney to the continent from conflict zones in the Middle East and Africa.


Orban has actively tried to stop the flow of undocumented people entering his country, which is on theBalkan routemany migrants and refugees take to reach hospitable countries like Germany. Scenes last weekof Hungarian police spraying water cannons and tear gassing people trying to cross the country's border underscore the lengths that the government is willing to go to.


Hungary has also employed other measures, including building an $80 million razor wire border fence andpassing legislationto deploy the army that is allowed to fire rubber bullets at migrants and refugees. The country's government has even taken out full page ads in Lebanese newspaperswarning people not to attempt the journey to its borders.



   Petr David Josek/Associated Press Hungary has spent millions of dollars on a razor wire border fence to deter migrant and refugee crossings.   While rights groups and the United Nations have condemned Orban's actions as inhumane and unacceptable, the prime minister's response to the crisis has shored up his popular supportat home.


A poll conducted earlier this month showed that a massive 82 percent of Hungarians favor tighter immigration controls, according to The Wall Street Journal. Orban's Fidesz party commands strong support from the public, which shows the prime minister's recurring knack of turning crisis into political opportunity.


Orban first rose to some prominence as a law graduate and student activist in the 1980s. In 1989, he called for free elections in Hungaryin a bold public speech. After Communism ended in Hungary, Orban directed his notoriety into carving out a political career as leader of the conservative-nationalist Fidesz party.


He served as a Fideszmember of parliament until 1998, when he was elected prime ministerat the age of 35.



   Istvan Csaba Toth/Associated Press Viktor Orban spoke out against Soviet rule in Hungary and called for free elections in 1989.   Fidesz lost the next election, in 2002, amid allegations of corruption, but Orban returned to power in 2010 in a landslide victory that gave the party a two-thirds majority in parliament. Once Orban was prime minister again, he made changes to the constitution that critics sayconsolidated state powerover courts and the media, and revealed the former dissident's growing autocratic streak.


Tens of thousands of Hungarians gathered in Budapestto demonstrate against Orban's government in 2012, chanting "Viktator" and protesting the new amendments, but his administration survived.



   Bela Szandelszky/Associated Press There were massive protests against Orban and the new Hungarian constitution in 2012.   Formerly aradical voice for liberalismin Hungary, last year Orbanopenly advocated for illiberal democracy, like Turkey's and Russia's, as a successful model for states. He has opposed EU influence over Hungary's policy decisions, andkicked outthe International Monetary Fund after the country received a multibillion dollar bailout.


Now, as the refugee and migrant crisis continues, Orban has once again balked at what he says is European interference in Hungary's national affairs. Ahead of Wednesday's summit, he saidGermany's "moral imperialism"shouldn't be imposed on Hungary.



   Petr David Josek/Associated Press A majority of Hungarians agree with Orban in favoring tighter immigration controls.   Orban's political stance has cast him as one of the primary antagonists, as the migrant crisis plays out, from the perspective of western EU states and rights groups. Hungary voted against oneEU relocation plan, passed Tuesday, to move 120,000 migrants and refugees from front line states like Italy and Greece.


The prime minister has also opposed the proposals favored by many European countries, including Germany, that wouldestablish a unified policy to deal with the crisis. These plans include establishinga quota systemthat would redistribute refugees across European states to more evenly share people and costs.


Hungary has previously voted against such a plan and Orban has decried quotas as "unfair" and "unwise," albeit saying that the country would be forced to complyif they are passed.

Instead of quotas, Orban has suggested a Hungarian plan that is designed to contain refugees and migrants in Syria's neighboring countries, where most of the people trying to reach Europe are coming from. Under the plana monetary fund will be set up into which nations are to contribute 1% of their EU contributions and 1% of their EU income, reported the BBC.


The money would then be used to strengthen border control and send aid to refugee camps primarily in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.


The plan reflects Orban's view that migrants and refugees should stay in countries like Turkey, where it is "safe." But while Orban purports to be discouraging migration because of its dangers, and the potential economic cost to Hungary, a significant part of the prime minister's rationale is purely religious and nationalist.


"We think all countries have a right to decide whether they want to have a large number of Muslims in their countries," Orban said earlier this month. "If they want to live together with them, they can. We dont want to and I think we have a right to decide that we do not want a large number of Muslim people in our country."

      The United States is experiencing a major human tragedy.Wehave more people in jail than any other country on earth, including Communist China, an authoritarian country four times our size. The U.S. has less than five percent of the world's population, yet we incarcerateabout a quarterof its prisoners --some2.2 million people.There are many ways that we must go forward to address this tragedy. One of them is to end the existence of theprivate for-profit prison industrywhich nowmakes millions from the incarceration of Americans. These private prisons interferewith the administration of justice. And they're driving inmate populations skyward by corrupting the political process.No one, in my view, should be allowed to profit from putting more people behind bars -- whether they're inmates in jail or immigrants held in detention centers. In fact, I believe that private prisons shouldn't be allowed to exist at all, which is why I've introduced legislation to eliminate them.Here's why:For-profit prisons harm minorities.The prison crisis has disproportionately harmed minorities. If current trends persist, one in four black males born today can expect to be imprisoned during their lifetime. Tragically, 69 percent of African-American men who drop out of high school will end up in jail, according to the most recent statistics.The Department of Justice found that black motorists were three times more likely than their white counterparts to be searched during a traffic stop. African Americans are twice as likely to be arrested, and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with police. Further, African Americans are imprisoned at six times the rate of whites.For-profit prisons abuse prisoners.The horror stories from for-profit prisons are plentiful. Here are a few examples:
 Rat-infested food was served to inmates by a private vendor inMichigan, and other rotten or spoiled food items were served in that state and elsewhere. The same vendor reportedly underfed Michigan inmates.
Privately-run prisons in Mississippi reportedly have two to three times the rate of violent assault as publicly run facilities.
A private prison vendor has reportedly used juvenile offenders in Florida to subdue other young prisoners. "It's the Lord of the Flies," said Broward County's chief assistant public defender. "The children are used by staff members to inflict harm on other children."
Nurses at a private prison chain in California threatened to strike over the inadequate health care, which one described as "unsafe," and there have even been reported incidents of patient abuse.

For-profit prisons victimize immigrants.Immigrants have also been victimized by corporate prison greed. As the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) notes in in an in-depth report, "The criminalization of immigration ... enriches the private prison industry" by segregating most of the resulting inmates into one of thirteen privately-run "Criminal Alien Requirement" (CAR) prisons. Another report, from Grassroots Leadership, found that 62 percent of all ICE beds are now privately owned.For-profit prisons profit from abuse and mistreatment.As the ACLU notes, the bidding process for private immigration centers provides "incentives that keep facilities overcrowded and place excessive numbers of prisoners in isolated confinement." It also reports inadequate medical care, abusive treatment, and "severely overcrowded and squalid living conditions."These are also true for prison populations.Prison industry money is corrupting the political process.The prison industry is highly profitable. The two biggest prison corporations in the country made $3.3 billion in 2012 -- profiting from government payments and prison laborers, who were forced to work for pennies on behalf of companies like Boeing and McDonald's.With so much money at stake, it's not surprising that the for-profit prison industry is corrupting our political process.According toNational Institute on Money in Politicsjust one such company, the GEO Group, has given more than $6 million to Republican, Democratic, and independent candidates over the past 13 years.Moreover, as the Washington Post reports, the two largest for-profit prison corporations and their associates "have funneled more than $10 million to candidates since 1989 and have spent nearly $25 million on lobbying efforts."For-profit prisons are influencing prison policy ...It's been money well spent for the prison corporations. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of for-profit prisons in this country has increased by 1,600 percent. There are now 130 private prisons in this country, with a total of 157,000 beds.Through organizations like ALEC (the American Legislative Exchange Council), the prison industry has promoted state laws that increase incarceration rates for nonviolent offenses....andimmigration policy.A report from the Council on Hemispheric Affairs outlines some of the ways in which private prison corporations have tried to influence immigration policy and increase incarceration rates, apparently with great success.Grassroots Leadership found that, "contrary to private prison corporation claims that they do not lobby on issues related to immigration policy, between 2008 and 2014, CCA spent $10,560,000 in quarters where they lobbied on issues related to immigrant detention and immigration reform."For-profit companies exploit prison families.Private prison corporations and their affiliates do everything they can to make a buck off people in prison -- and their families. According to The Nation's Liliana Segura, for example, a tech company called Global Tel*Link charges more than $1 per minute for families and friends to speak with their loved ones in prison. There is no free market, no competition to drive the price down.If family or friends are unable to afford Global Tel*Link's prices, prisoners may run a higher risk of social isolation. It's a vicious circle, as studies show that social connections arekeyto a prisoner's rehabilitation process once he or she is released. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a leader on this issue, has also pointed out that 2.7 million children in the United States have an incarcerated parent. Many of them suffer immeasurably when such unaffordable rates rob them of parental contact.Global Tel* Link makes more than $500 million per year from exploiting these vulnerable people.Young people are being mistreated and exploited.Worst of all, the for-profit system is having a terrible impact on our young people. A Huffington Post report entitled "Prisoners of Profit," paints a vivid picture of the widespread abuse and brutality -- including fatal medical neglect and sexual abuse. In the "kids for cash" scandal, business people actually paid judges to send young people to their often-brutal facilities, often for very minor infractions.We must put an end to this shameful industry.I have introduced legislation that will put an end to for-profit prisons. My legislation will bar federal, state, and local governments from contracting with private companies to manage prisons, jails, or detention facilities. Regulators will be directed to prevent companies from charging unreasonable fees for services like banking and telecommunications.My legislation also takes steps to reduce our bloated inmate population. It reinstates the federal parole system, which was abolished in the 1980s, so that officials can individually assess each prisoner's risk and chance for rehabilitation. It ends the immigrant detention quota, which requires officials to hold a minimum of 34,000 people captive at any given time. And it would end the detention of immigrant families, many of whom are currently held in privately-owned facilities in Texas and Pennsylvania.It's wrong to profit from the imprisonment of human beings and the suffering of their friends and families. It's time to end this morally repugnant practice, and along with it, the era of mass incarceration.There are plenty of other people in this world who are as miserable as you are right now.If you want to know what your values are, just look at your own life. Your life looks like your values. A lot of us think we have higher or spiritual values, but those values are not necessarily reflected in our so-called personal lives.The World is proving incapable of addressing its greatest challenges. An ageing population is no longer limited to developed nations. Many developing countries particularly in the Balkans are facing the pressure of ageing.It seems like we're having the time of our lives. And don't get me wrong: we are. But it's not all ice-creams and pretty landscapes. So far, I think we've tallied 135toilets scrubbed, 250kilos of cow dung spread, two tons of rocks shoveled and 60 meters of pathway laid, for starters.

On Wednesday the benevolent brothers joined the BBCs DIY SOS,a reality show that refurbishes homes, to help build abodes for vets struggling with a range of health and financial problems in Manchester. The shows biggest build to date will renovate eight empty homes and update 62 properties, according to the BBC.


Altogether, 26 homes will be reserved for veterans,according to People.


Both veterans themselves, William and Harry were eager to get their hands dirty with the construction project.


They donned hard hats, which had their respective names emblazoned on them, and got to work getting the project off the ground.


William painted a kitchen and Harry laid paving stones in a garden.

Prince William and Prince Harry helped to renovate houses for ex-service personnel as part of the BBC television series DIY SOS. (Manchester, England, UK)   They were joined by 240 volunteers and builderswho hope to complete the campaign by the end of the week, according to BT.com.


William and Harry also met with a number of the veterans whom their volunteer work is helping.


The two spoke with Lamin Manneh, a triple amputee who has five children and was never able to read to his kids at bedtime because he couldn'tget up the stairs in his home, according to BT.com.


The show has enabled Manneh to get an accessible home and he told the BBC that it now gives him "hope."


In addition to building the homes, the project will erect a support center, which will help vets with physical or mental health issues, according to the BBC. Its getting support from the Royal British Legion and Walking with the Wounded, a charity of which Harry has been a longtime supporter.

(Phil Noble/Pool via AP)   He joined the group on treks to the North and South Poles and plans on completing a 1,000-mile journey with the group around Britain, according to the Associated Press.


Residents benefiting from the program told the BBC that they hope that it inspires other similar initiatives to help veterans struggling to reintegrate into society and William and Harry hope their work will keep vets in the public eye.


Currently, an estimated 9,000 vets in England are sleeping on the streets.

Over the past year, I had several conversations about sexual compulsivity. Collecting background information for Sexed, a novel about sex addiction, I learned that the problem, in various interpretations, is a serious concern for many gay men.I also realize that sometimes parents don't expect or want their children to be gay, in the same way they don't expect or want their children to go around acting like 1970s Thor but sometimes they are one of these things, and sometimes they are both.Perhaps when police brutality ends, when trans murders stop, and when alcoholism is no longer a problem plaguing our community, it'll be time to have a party.

Familiares de los estudiantes desaparecidos se reunieron este jueves con el presidente Pea Nieto en la Ciudad de Mxico.Las conclusiones de un grupo de expertos internacionales que fueron dadas a conocer recientemente, derrumbaron la "verdad histrica" con la que el ex procurador Jess Murillo Karam, pretenda dar carpetazo al asunto. Entre muchos aspectos determinaron que los cuerpos de los jvenes no pudieron ser cremados en un basurero como afirmaron las autoriades mexicanas.Su palabra no fue honrada. En vez de que se haya procurado la justicia y la verdad, se procur la mentira.Reiteraron la responsabilidad del Estado en el crimen que ha sacudido a todo el pas: "fue el Estado el que permiti que la narcopoltica se afincara en Guerrero, el que gener una mentira histrica que hoy ha sido evidenciada, el que nos tortur al privilegiar los tiempos polticos antes que los derechos de las vctimas".Estas son las ocho exigencias que hicieron los padres de los 43 al presidente Pea Nieto:Reconocimiento de la legitimidad de nuestra bsqueda de justicia y de que el caso se encuentra abierto.
Permanencia del GIEI, aceptacin plena del informe del GIEI y sus recomendaciones.
Replanteamiento de la investigacin en una unidad especializada de investigacin, con supervisin internacional, compuesta por dos instancias: una que indague a profundidad dnde estn nuestros hijos y otra que investigue el montaje con que se nos pretendi engaar.
Relanzamiento y concentracin de la bsqueda a partir del uso inmediato de tecnologa.
Atencin digna e inmediata a los heridos y familiares de nuestros compaeros ejecutados extrajudicialmente.
Respeto a la Normal Rural Ral Isidro Burgos y cese a los intentos de criminalizacin de los normalistas.
Mecanismos de comunicacin permanente, digna y con respeto a nuestros derechos.
Reconocimiento y acciones de fondo frente a la crisis de impunidad, corrupcin y violaciones a derechos humanos que vive Mxico.Por su parte, el mandatario asegur que l es el principal interesado en conocer la verdad, "se los reitero: estamos del mismo lado y trabajamos con el mismo objetivo, el de saber qu sucedi con sus hijos y castigar a todos y cada uno de los responsables".Se dio a conocer en conferencia de prensa al finalizar el encuentro que Pea Nieto instruy a su equipo a analizar el pliego petitorio de los padres.En la reunin tambin participaron el Secretario de Gobernacin, Miguel ngel Osorio Chong; el Comisionado Nacional de Seguridad, Renato Sales; la Procuradora General de la Repblica, Arely Gmez Gonzlez, y el subsecretario de Derechos Humanos de Gobernacin, Roberto Campa Cifrin.Para este sbado, da del aniversario, se espera una marcha de protesta multitudinaria en la Ciudad de Mxico.

By the time I was three years old, I had quickly picked up the English language through watching Sesame Street and Barney & Friends religiously. Education came easy for me, partly because my mother is a teacher and from a young age, she would always have me read books. I never objected because I loved reading and learning. In first grade, I quickly excelled in reading, so I would be taken out of my bilingual classroom and be placed in an English-speaking classroom for an hour each day. Third grade came and I was no longer in a bilingual classroom, but an all English-speaking one. I felt as if I were in limbo because my English wasn't perfect, and at the same time, my Spanish was becoming rusty because I wasn't immersed in it daily anymore. I vividly remember being made fun of because of this. Kids would laugh at me because I could not speak Spanish or English "correctly." I obviously did not want the teasing to continue, so I subconsciously made the decision to lose my "Mexican" accent and pretend like I didn't know how to speak Spanish very well.Being a top student in school was extremely important to me, so throughout middle school and high school I would do my best to achieve just that. At the same time, I would see my Latino peers struggling in their English as a Second Language classes. Most of them were living in poverty or were not citizens, and would express how they would never be able to attend college, so why bother doing well. Instead of encouraging them and showing them how we Latinos can succeed, I separated myself from the group. I didn't want to be identified as a Latina because I didn't want to be mistaken as an ESL student, as if that were something to be ashamed of. I wanted people to see me as a successful, bright student who had a future and would one day go to college. With this mentality, I never was grouped together with my Latino peers. People didn't even identify me as a Latina, and if they did, I would be called a "white" Mexican. At the end of my high school career, I was top 10 percent and had been accepted to a university. But I had completely lost my Mexican roots, culture and I felt ashamed for being ashamed of who I was.I wouldn't make that same mistake in college. The second I stepped on my campus, I knew I was one of the few Latinos there, and that was extremely discouraging. That observation, however, changed my mentality of trying to climb to the top and not worry about who was left behind. Instead, it motivated me to embrace the few Latinos on campus and see them as my brothers and sisters. We all had a common goal: earn a college degree.My mentality growing up was 100 percent unacceptable and I hope that no one ever feels ashamed of where they come from. We Latinos have to stick together and help each other achieve our dreams of earning a higher education. I am blessed to have graduated college in four years, but it is now my turn to take what I have learned and show the Latino community that they too can dream big. Today, I help out in an after-school program with at-risk kids and a majority of my students are Latinos. I want to redeem myself for all of the years I didn't spend encouraging my Latino peers to pursue their dreams. Because I am fluent in Spanish, (and not afraid to show it) I can easily communicate with my ESL students and help them with their homework. But most importantly, I can be their mentor and show them that if they work hard, they too can become a Latino college graduate.




European politicians may be waffling over what to dowith an incredible influx of refugees from the Middle East, but not Norway's Petter Stordalen.


The Norwegian billionaire, owner of Scandinavian hotel chain Nordic Choice Hotels, has pledged 5,000 free nights in his hotelsto refugees temporarily in need of a place to stay. True to his word, he hosted 50 Syrian refugees this Sunday, reports Aftenposten, a Norwegian paper, putting the group up at the Quality Hotel Airport Gardermoen outside of Oslo.

   September 8, 2015"The world is seeing the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II, Stordalen told Forbes, explaining his decision.Itsimpossible not to be affected by the human tragedy and by whats occurring in the Middle East.


"They cant sleep in the streets, he said.


He added the hotels are coordinating with police to ensure guests are securely escorted back to immigration officials the next day, aftermaking sure they're properly fed.



   News Oresund/Flickr Petter Stordalen is seen speaking in this undated Flickr photo. The Norwegian hotel magnate is donating 5,000 hotel rooms to Syrian refugees in need of a place to stay.   Norway's Directorate of Immigration (UDI) told Agence-France Presse it would house migrantsin Stordalen's hotels only if its own resources were at capacity.


"We appreciate Mr. Stordalens offer and we'll consider using his hotelswhen and if the situation is really urgent," Christine Wilberg, the director of Department for Regions, Reception and Return at the UDI told Newsweek. "The most important thing right now, however, is to find more permanent housing for the refugees."

   Credit: Markus Luukkonen/Lehtikuva/Associated Press   HELSINKI, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Demonstrators threw stones and launched fireworks at a bus full of asylum seekers arriving at a reception center in Lahti in southern Finland, late on Thursday, Finnish media reported on Friday.


Between 30 and 40 demonstrators, one in a white robe like those worn by the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan in the United States, waved the Finnish flag and shouted abuse at the bus.


Some demonstrators also hurled stones and let off fireworks at the vehicle carrying 40 asylum seekers, including several young children, Finnish television YLE said.


Meanwhile, a petrol bomb was thrown at another reception center in Kouvola, also in southern Finland, police said. No one was known to be hurt in the incidents."The Finnish government strongly condemns last night's racist protests against asylum seekers who had entered the country," the government said in a statement. "Violence or the threat of violence is always to be condemned."


Prime Minister Juha Sipila this month offered to take in refugees at his home, a move that attracted international attention but also criticism in Finland.


"Sipila's noble-minded gesture was like a Christmas gift for human traffickers and refugees. The news about open doors in Finland have sent many young men on a journey towards the promised land," Mika Niikko, a deputy from anti-immigrant party The Finns, said last week in a statement.


So far this year more than 13,000 asylum seekers, most of them from Iraq, have come to Finland, compared to just 3,600 in the whole of last year.



   Credit: Markku Ulander/AFP/Getty Images Iraqis rest in a refugee center in Lahti, Finland, on Sept. 25, 2015, after demonstrator attack their bus with stones and fireworks as it entered the city the night before.   In recent days, about 500 refugees per day have crossed the Finnish land border in Tornio, near the Arctic Circle, after a long journey through Sweden.


The Finnish government has launched random border checks and identity checks around the country amid the influx of refugees.


Finland was the only European Union state to abstain from this week's vote about relocating asylum seekers across the member countries. It accepted its 2 percent share of 120,000 asylum seekers in question but said it was opposed to a mandatory quota system.

The White House on Wednesday released a report outlining the current state of education for Native American students, bleakly declaring that "Native youth -- and Native education -- are in a state of emergency."The report, titled "2014 Native Youth Report," accompanied an announcement from President Barack Obama that the administration is launching an  initiative to increase opportunities for Native American youth, called Generation Indigenous. Ahniwake Rose, executive director for the National Indian Education Association, called the White House's new initiative and report "unprecedented," noting that "this is the first time that a sitting president has talked about Indian education since Kennedy."
Still, Rose told The Huffington Post that the president's efforts are just an important first step, and significant progress needs to be made. The White House report offers some reasons for this needed progress, and paints a dim picture of the current status of education for Native American students.Here are four key findings from the report on the current state and history of Native American education:1. Even In 1944, Politicians Wanted To Send Native American Students To Boarding Schools To Learn The 'White Mans Way Of Life.'According to the White House report, colonial settlers established the first boarding school for Native American students in 1754. The purpose of these boarding schools was to assimilate the students and effectively eliminate their connections to Native American society and culture, the report says. Parents who refused to send their children to these schools ultimately faced repercussions from the federal government. "By removing children from the 'corrupting' influences of their families and everyday reservation life for years at a time, these institutions usurped Indian parenting responsibilities, tore apart tribal kinship networks, and destroyed the fabric of Indian communities," the report says.By the early 1900s, policy towards Native Americans had shifted, with politicians ultimately deciding that tribes should have more sovereignty over their children's educations. But enthusiasm for this policy shift was not unanimous. Even in 1944, the House Select Committee on Indian Affairs said, The goal of Indian education should be to make the Indian child a better American rather than to equip him simply to be a better Indian," recommending that these children return to boarding schools.2. A Vast Majority Of Native American Students Attend Public Schools

In this Sept. 25, 2014, photo, students walk near Little Singer Community School in Birdsprings, Arizona, on the Navajo Nation. (AP Photo/John Locher).Ninety-two percent of Native American students attend regular public schools, meaning that only a small minority attend schools controlled by the federally funded Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). The BIE operates 183 schools on 63 reservations for about 42,000 students, according to the report. These students generally perform worse academically than their peers, the report says, with fourth-grade students in BIE schools performing on average 22 points worse in reading on the 2013 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) than other Native American students. Still, in 2011, only 18 percent of all Native American students were deemed proficient or above in reading on NAEP, while 42 percent of white students were proficient or above. 3. Many BIE Schools Are In Dismal ConditionThe report paints a startling picture of conditions in BIE schools. According to the report, about $967 million is needed to make necessary repairs to BIE schools, and about 30 percent of BIE schools are more than 40 years old. A majority of these schools do not have satisfactory Internet access or enough computers to take assessments aligned with the new Common Core State Standards, the report says.4. There Is A Lack Of Culturally Relevant Curriculum For Native Students In Schools

In this Sept. 25, 2014, photo, fifth grader Jamika Salas looks out the window of a school bus after school at the Little Singer Community School in Birdsprings, Arizona, on the Navajo Nation.(AP Photo/John Locher)Among one of the root causes for low Native American academic achievement is the lack of "culturally relevant curriculum and culturally competent staff that understand how to reach Native youth," says the report. To rectify this, the report recommends that schools and colleges work to revitalize Native American history and languages in school curriculum."Experience suggests that incorporating Native languages and culture into academic settings can improve educational engagement and outcomes. Such practices bolster their identity and self-worth of Native youth by respecting the norms and culture of their families and communities," says the report.Indeed, few states have educational standards that teach modern Native American history. According to research from Sarah Shear, an assistant professor of social studies education at Pennsylvania State University in Altoona, nearly 87 percent of state history standards fail to cover Native American history past the year of 1900.   Large donations are troublesome because they suggest the donor will have outsized influence on the politician if elected. It's more troublesome when these great friends own businesses that seek to avoid government accountability for harms to the American people.While at Gordon -- while faithfully attending the required Bible classes and chapel services -- something strange happened.

Super Tuesday is upon us. As people go to the polls in ten states on Tuesday, what should they be looking at in choosing their candidates?Even in 2012, higher education still revolves around issues of race and class. This idea that "not everyone needs to go to college" fails to acknowledge the specific students that get ignored and silenced as a result of the races and classes they're born into.Rick Santorum is absolutely right that higher education is a liberal and secular force in our society at present. But he's also highly simplistic in his view that it creates liberals or atheists -- or that it intentionally discriminates against conservatives or the devout.

Just as there are a plurality of reasons why a family may choose homeschooling, so too there are a plurality of reasons why a family may choose public schooling. Today we have the wine snob, the beer snob, the cheese snob, the opera snob, the film snob and countless other varieties. One definition of the food snob that amused me is "a person who looks down on those who do not know the difference between a daube and a navarin."

Santorum needn't worry. America is already making it harder for young people of modest means to attend college. Public higher education is being starved, and the middle class will shrink even more as a result.

An online language learning platform is unveiling a new course that could help Arabic-speaking refugees find jobs in Western Europe.


Duolingo, a website and app that offers free language courses, announced plans on Tuesday to introduce German language lessons for Arabic speakers. "German for Arabic speakers" will provide instructionin speaking, reading, writing and listening, and is expected to become available on Oct. 3.


The company's goal is "helping people gain better opportunities and improve their lives no matter the situation they find themselves in," Gina Gotthilf, Duolingo's vice president of communications, told The WorldPost in an email. "Language education is generally unaffordable to most, but can actually double one's income potential in most countries."


"The mission applies perfectly to the situation in which Syrian immigrants in Germany find themselves in, and we thought we were in a fortuitous position to help make a difference," Gotthilf added.


Duolingolaunched the course to help Syrian refugees moving to Germany, the company wrote onTwitterand Facebook. But the course could actually benefit many more people: Refugees from Arabic-speaking countries like Iraq, Libya and Sudan could also profit from the course, and they would also be able to find work in Austria, where German is the official language.




Germany expects to receiveone million migrants and refugees this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel. The country also has about half a million jobsto fill, The New York Times reported on Sept. 17.


But in order to prosper in any host country, it is imperative to learn its language.


Earlier in September, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that her government would spend an additional 2 billion euros($2.2 billion) in language training for migrants and refugees seeking employment in Germany, The New York Times reported. In a Sept. 18 meeting with federal ministers, Gabriel also stressed the importanceof German language trainingin schools and refugee reception centers so newcomers become properly integrated into German society.


The Internet reacted enthusiastically to Duolingo's announcement. In Facebook comments, many users applauded Duolingo for its effort to help migrants and refugees settle in Europe; some even asked for an Arabic course for German speakers.




Duolingo is not the only language platform that aims to bridge the communication gap between Syrian refugees and Westerners. NaTakallam, a language startup created by three Columbia University grads, will enable Syrian refugees to work as "language partners" with Arabic language learners over the Internet.


Currently, Duolingoonly offers Englishlanguage courses to Arabic speakers, but hopes to launch more language courses for Arabic speakers in the future, Gotthilf told WorldPost.


"A lot of fans on Facebook have been asking for Portuguese given the recent influx of immigrants in Brazil," she observed.

The only real purpose of these havens is to facilitate tax evasion, money laundering, bribery, and lack of accountability for environmental and social calamities inflicted by international companies.  Now, a new analysis by a group of international organizations throws this system into sharp relief. Figures from the Enough Food for Everyone IF campaign -- supported by almost 200 organizations including Actionaid, Christian Aid, Oxfam, and Save the Children -- are revealing more about the extent of these havens.  There are trillions of dollars tied up in the tax havens, with massive worldwide evasion of tax payments that undermines the budgets of rich and poor countries alike.  The IF campaign makes a basic point: poverty can be fought, and austerity overcome, IF taxes are properly paid by those who owe them.  Ending the tax havens and their financial secrecy is therefore urgent.  The IF Campaign is taking place just in time for this week's meeting of the finance ministers of the G7 nations -- the world's financial superpowers, and the greatest promoters of this corrupted system.  They need to take action.  Their deliberations feed into the June meeting of the G8 countries (consisting of the G7, plus Russia), where the potential for action to end these abuses lies.  During the boom years, the rich and powerful kept the public distracted from the tax haven reality. Yet now with budget austerity, the public is having a close look at tax evasion by the rich and powerful.  As a result, the veil over the tax havens has started to slip, and the sight is not lovely.  Mitt Romney ran for U.S. president with vast wealth in the Cayman Islands, and was never willing to account for that wealth.  The French budget minister, and then the Socialist campaign finance manager, got caught with their own offshore accounts.  Another leading French politician, the recent treasurer of the Hollande campaign, has also acknowledged secret offshore accounts.  Rich Greeks with secret accounts abroad are on lists provided by the International Monetary Fund.  Spanish officials have been caught receiving stipends from secret offshore accounts.  And this is only the tip of the iceberg.  The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has recently begun to release the names of rich and powerful offshore banking customers.The recent banking crisis in Cyprus has also exposed the macroeconomic risks of this nefarious system.  Everybody knew that Cyprus was a tax-and-secrecy haven, especially for Russian funds, but few anticipated that the euro would almost die in a blow-up of Cypriot banks.  But why shouldn't they have known?  This is par for the course when a country is home to bank assets and liabilities many times larger than the country's national income.  The banks had no backstopping.  How many times must we learn the lesson?Thanks to eye-opening (indeed eye-popping) books such as Treasure Islands by Nicholas Shaxson, we also have come to appreciate better that the havens are not the un-pluggable gaps of a well-regulated global economy, but are actually part of the core design of the global financial system.  Switzerland and the United Kingdom essentially invented much of the system during the early to mid-20th century; the United States became its great champion more recently.  The Caribbean havens -- Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Caymans -- are British overseas territories.  The United States is itself increasingly a haven for foreign investors, especially in Delaware, and it is also the great proponent of the Caribbean haven system.  And how absurd and dangerous this system has become.  The Caymans' 56,000 people host 92,000 companies.  The hedge fund industry, managing trillions of dollars, is largely domiciled there.  The Bank of International Settlements, which collects data on cross-border banking assets, estimates that $1.4 trillion in bank assets and liabilities are there, around $25 million per person!  This is a time bomb, not a financial system.  Not surprisingly, the so-called "boards" of these companies, which are supposed to "govern" them, are routinely filled with individuals who sit on dozens, or even hundreds of boards.  The situation is absurd, dangerous and out of control.   The politicians of rich nations who protect the exorbitant privileges of bankers and hedge-fund managers, who wink at mega-tax evasion by billionaires, and who tolerate unpardonable games played by major companies, are playing with fire. We are now all sharing austerity.  The havens represent unacceptable privilege and abuse, not fair sharing.    Developing countries too are saying that enough is enough.  For decades they've been on the receiving end of hypocritical lectures about good governance.  For them, the tax havens have served the purpose of paying bribes to potentates, and providing easy ways for elites to keep their money safe from tax collectors.  Yet it is the rich countries that have fostered that system.  The world's most powerful countries have a unique responsibility.  They created this destructive system.  It's now their job to end it.  Taxes worldwide need to be paid. Offshore accounts need to be reported back to the national authorities of the account holders. Banks, hedge funds and non-financial companies need to be domiciled where they can be properly overseen and regulated -- not on small islands that can't possibly oversee these businesses. The politicians need to understand that the public is now on to the game.  There is no more time to delay.

                        Why is coming out of the closet not an issue anymore?

What started as a civil war in Syria nearly five years ago has now evolved into an international crisis unmatched by any other since World War II.

Boehner certainly picked an interesting time to step down.  Before his announcement, we were facing the possibility of a government shutdown as early as next week. However, the Senate doesn't seem to be backing the "shut it down" caucus on this particular fracas.So if guys like Trump must have it this way--regardless of whether it's because hatred is politically expedient or because they really feel that way--it should be understood that there is no place for them in the world of rock and roll. It's time to accept it and move on.

At a forum Tuesday with a group of non-profit agencies, Matt Bevin took on my portrayal of his comments about early childhood development during a debate during the Republican primary, saying that his comments were taken out of context.Matt Bevin(Photo: AP)So I went back to a video of the debate on Kentucky Educational Television and transcribed everything he said on the subject. I also went back and found what I wrote that night and every instance The Courier-Journal has mentioned Bevin and Head Start or early childhood education since then and am including them here.But first, let's go to the tape on what he said on Tuesday."There's been an extraordinary amount, by you Joe, and others, misinterpretation of my view of this and I hold you personally responsible for that because it's intentional. You're smart enough to know what I really am saying and what I'm calling for, yet you take things out of quotation, you take things out of context, you take three-word sound bites out of a two paragraph statement to try to repaint my position. I have nine children. Four of my children are adopted. We talk about those who have nothing. My children started with nothing, some of them. Look at the decisions I've made in my life personally. To paint the picture intentionally that I don't believe in, that I'm not a supporter of, that I'm not an advocate of early childhood education is a mistruth. It's an absolute and outright lie and to continue to perpetuate it is irresponsible. We need education across the board on all fronts. What does that look like, what does that look like. "So, here's what he said at the KET forum in May:"In a nutshell, I would say to Tina, (who sent in the question) was it, we've spent since the inception of Head Start, for example, more than $170 billion on that program since its inception. Every single metric that has ever looked at it, including those done by the government itself in order to justify it and those looking at it from the outside trying to justify why it doesn't work, everyone has come to the same conclusion, that third grade and above, there is no measurable difference between a child who came through Head Start and a child that did not. First and second, there is a difference, third grade and beyond, no difference whatsoever, which means we've spent $170 billion on something that after the age of 9 serves no purpose. If we're putting out kids into the workforce at the age of 9, I say giddy-up let's give 'em some more Head Start and lets expand it down to 4 years old but in the meantime , if we're not getting what we want from the program , let's rethink those hundreds of billions of dollars that we're pumping in. I have 9 children I'm a big believer in childhood education but we've got to be smart about getting a good return on the investment of those dollars."Host Bill Goodman followed up: "So, you're saying  that the evidence is not clear under the current system that early childhood education is worthwhile, it's not that you are negative or don't believe in early childhood education."Bevin replied: "No I'm saying the evidence is very clear that it is not working the way we're doing it and yet absolutely I believe that early childhood education is important and we should be putting everything that we have at it but not the current methodology were using and doubling down on it."We're not going to get into a long debate over whether or not Head Start works or not but here is a piece on that very subject that appeared in the Washington Post.You can watch the KET debate here. The issue arises about the 34 minute mark.Here's what I wrote on deadline the night of the debate:"Gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin called for reconsidering money spent on early childhood education, saying that the current Head Start program isn't working.During an hour-long debate on Kentucky Educational Television, Bevin, businessman Hal Heiner, Agriculture Commissioner James Comer and former state Supreme Court Justice Will T. Scott sparred on issues.Bevin argued that early childhood education helps kids when they are in 1st and 2nd grades but that those gains are wiped out by the 3rd grade.'Which means we've spent $170 billion on something that after the age of 9 serves no purpose,' Bevin said. 'If we're putting our kids in the workforce at the age of 9, I say giddy-up, lets give 'em some more head start.'Bevin didn't say with what he would replace the current early childhood education, but said in a later interview, 'What I don't believe in is doubling down on the existing programs that are clearly not working.'Since Bevin accused the newspaper of continually trying to perpetuate lies about what he said, I went back and found every reference to him and early childhood education and every reference to him and Head Start after that. I found two. One in a column by Al Cross after the primary and one in a story by the Associated Press last month. Here's what Cross wrote: "Gov. Steve Beshear started that Wednesday morning in his monthly interview with Jack Pattie on Lexington's WVLK-AM. Beshear said Conway wants to expand early-childhood education, while Bevin wants to repeal it. Actually, Bevin said in a debate that the program should be reconsidered because research shows the benefits of the federal Head Start program disappear by the third grade.That's one of several examples of Bevin's trouble with the facts. Head Start is a much narrower program than early-childhood education, which among the states is usually a more comprehensive program."And then the AP story last month following the first meeting between Bevin and Conway: "Democrats are trying to capitalize on Bevin's comments about early childhood education at a debate among GOP gubernatorial candidates this spring. Bevin said in the debate that early childhood education helps children in first and second grades but that those gains are wiped out after that.Bevin said Friday that claims he doesn't support early childhood education are 'absolute bunk.'The Republican said funding allocations from preschool through college need to be scrutinized. And he recommended changes in the way the state distributes money for higher education to ensure students are ready for skilled jobs.'It's largely allocated due to politics,' Bevin said. 'We need outcomes-based funding.'"Neither Bevin nor his campaign called to complain about my portrayal of his comments the night of the KET debate. Cross told me that neither Bevin nor his campaign called him to complain about his column. Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1MsHpDt404 Request ErrorPlease check the URLThe Quiet Revolution

As usual, weve been reading stuff this week. Good stuff, bad stuff, and everything in between. Luckily for you, were only...                    An old "Sesame Street" clip making its rounds on the Internet is further proving the show's longevity.


The educational show for kids is still around, but a scene from years ago has recently gained some popularity on Viral Thread's Facebook page. The video features Herry Monster counting to 20 with a boy he calls John John, and has been viewed more than 10 million times since being posted on July 8.


As soon as little John John lays down the law with Herry Monster and says, "I go first, you go second," we knew we were in for a treat.




According to The New York Times, John John was 2 years old when he made his "Sesame Street" debut in 1971. He went on to do more skits with other beloved "Sesame Street" charactersas a kid and reunited with his pals to make an appearance as an adult in the 1989 TV special "Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting"and recreate his adorable scene with Herry. He gave his furry friend a quick update on his life, shared that he went by John Williams now and of course let him know that he'd count first and Herry could go second.


WASHINGTON -- Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton came out on Thursday in full support of allowing certain undocumented young people to join the military, as the House of Representatives debates the issue.Her campaign issued a statement in support of allowing young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, often called Dreamers, to enlist.  "If these courageous young men and women want to serve, they should be honored and celebrated, not discriminated against," Clinton's national political director, Amanda Renteria, said. "Hillary Clinton is committed to comprehensive immigration reform to strengthen families and our country. While we keep up the pressure for comprehensive action, allowing Dreamers to serve in the military is the right step forward.
The House is set to vote later Thursday on whether to strip a measure from the National Defense Authorization Act that would encourage the secretary of defense to consider allowing certain Dreamers to enlist. The measure, offered by Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) does not mandate that the Defense Department allow more Dreamers to join the military. But it still caused controversy among Republicans, who said it would be an implicit endorsement of the "amnesty" programs by President Barack Obama. Democrats are arguing that all Dreamers granted work authorization under Obama's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, should be able to enlist, although Gallego's measure would not require such a policy change. Clinton has taken a liberal turn on immigration during her presidential campaign this year. She recently voiced support for driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants, after opposing them during her 2008 presidential campaign. Last month, Clinton told a group of Dreamers that she would support going even further than Obama to protect certain undocumented immigrants from deportation. Bill Maher praised Pope Francis' views on climate change on "Real Time" Friday night.


While admitting to have "mixed feelings" about the pope, the host did appreciate his views on this particular topic, especially in contrast to those held by many Republican representatives in Congress.


"I think it's just awesome that this pope took on this issue," Maher said. "I love that Boehner invited him to talk to Congress, and there he was the Grandmaster Flash of crazy non-evidentiary nonsense, lecturing the Republicans on reality."


Elsewhere in the episode, Maher discussed British Prime Minister David Cameron, Kim Davis and Josh Duggar.


 WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is facing increased pressure to change his position on drilling in the Atlantic Ocean -- and not just from environmental groups.


Yes, environmental groups are against the move to expand offshore drilling. On Monday, a major coalition of environmental groups sent Obama a letter urging him to end all new leases for fossil fuels, including for offshore oil in the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Arctic, as well as coal and natural gas development on public lands. The "Keep it in the Ground" effort says ending new leases would help prevent 450 billion tons of carbon pollution from entering the atmosphere.


But the pushback on offshore drilling in the Atlantic is even broader, including a number of cities and towns along the southeast coast.


The Obama administration announced in January that it will open new areas of the Atlantic to offshore lease sales under the 2017-2022 plan. That includes areas off the coast of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. That was just the first step in the process; the administration took public comment on the draft plan through March, and must still conduct an environmental impact analysis and release a final plan before the actual lease sale would be held. The Atlantic was left available for offshore drilling in 2008, when President George W. Bush lifted a presidential ban on Outer Continental Shelf development and Congress allowed its longstanding moratorium to expire.


With the lease sale planning process still underway, there's a growing volume of dissent from coastal voices.


Charleston, South Carolina's city council passed a resolution opposing drilling in March. Savannah, Georgia's council unanimously approved a similar resolution in April. The Wilmington, North Carolina council followed suit in July. And the Myrtle Beach city council approved an anti-drilling resolution in August, as did two North Carolina beach communities in early September. At least 75 coastal communities have taken action in opposition to drilling, according to a tally from the environmental group Oceana.


"After some soul searching, Im not going to be a part of it," said Myrtle Beach Councilman Mike Lowder, the Sun News reported. "I'm not going to support anything that's going to have the potential to destroy our beach."


The governors of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia have all endorsed drilling. But Sierra Weaver, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, notes that opposition is growing and, in many of these areas, has been bipartisan. "It's been a slow process of the communities waking up and saying, 'This isn't our vision for the coast,'" said Weaver.


There's growing pushback from businesses, too. A group of 300 Atlantic coastal businesses organized by the group Environment America sent the administration a letter last week citing concerns about the potential for oil spills and the harm drilling could do to other economic activity. The list included a variety of tourism, fishing and restaurant businesses.


"Offshore drilling is incompatible with our tourism and fishing industries," they wrote. "The potential economic losses that new offshore drilling would bring to our existing coastal economies and the potential for damage to treasured coasts and marine resources would be devastating."


Weaver predicts that more cities, towns and businesses along the coast will make their opposition to drilling heard: "These are communities that know that their way of life and their economies and livelihoods depend on a clean coast."

With former NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle's vision of "parity" having become a reality, it's hard to stand on one's hind legs and confidently make bold predictions.  With that said, here are five intrepid predictions for the 2015 season.

In a culture overly saturated with "political correctness" -- where the slightest comment challenging social norms is vociferously attacked -- it was refreshing to read a post asserting that any honor or success must be earned and not assumed.

John Ewing
Director of Research and Analytics at PredictionMachine.comI don't spend a lot of time with my family in general. I think the main reason is that I'm the crazy-progressive-political relative, but part of it is that I'm a lesbian -- one who doesn't blend and pass quietly as an unmarried lady with a lady roommate who happens to come along to family events. Few people are overtly rude, but the expectation that I not make waves is very strong.

Woody Johnson, hope you are listening.The New York Jets avoided setting a franchise record for consecutive losses by defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers 20-13 Sunday afternoon. Michael Vick threw two touchdowns and the Jets forced four turnovers in the win.

He has the industry experience and understanding of a veteran, but the hunger and work ethic of a rookie. A mix like that is not one that comes along often, and is the perfect blend for success.Abhi Sinha is a busy guy. Big on sports, Abhi fell into acting during college. Now really, how do you choose between sports and acting? Tough call that Abhi made! But look at him now!That shiny first date newness of Week 1 has worn off and it's time to settle in for the long grind of the season. But here's the thing, it's still too early to really know what kind of talent these teams have.I've greatly enjoyed my time, but I no longer wish to put my body at risk for the sake of entertainment. I think about the rest of my life and I want to live it with much quality. And physically, I am grateful that I can walk away feeling as good as I did when I stepped into it.Whatever happened in Week 17, it was still pretty incredible that, after starting the season at 0-4 (the first time since 1968), the Steelers STILL had a shot at the playoffs -- of course with a lot of help.After everything that went down, with one regular season game left, the Steelers are 7-8 and still in playoff contention. What a game. What a win.

Thank you for leaving me. Thank you for not believing in me, for shattering my self-confidence along with my heart, for being "the one that got away." From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

In a world beset by so many challenges, problems and disputes, it is a sign of hope that more than 150 world leaders will gather this week at the United Nations to adopt a new vision for the future well-being of all humankind.World leaders are coming to New York because they understand the need to steer the world onto a safer, more equitable and more sustainable trajectory. At the heart of the new agenda are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): 17 bold yet achievable goals that aim to end poverty, fight inequality, tackle climate change and build peaceful societies by the year 2030.Also known as the "Global Goals for Sustainable Development," the SDGs are the result of the most open and transparent consultation process in the history of the United Nations, in which individuals, community organizations, businesses, scientists, academics and other partners worked with Governments. Millions of people shared their vision for a better world and what is needed to attain it. The result is truly the people's agenda. The Goals are universal; they apply to all countries, since we know that even the wealthiest have yet to conquer poverty or achieve full gender equality. No one goal is more important than any other; they are integrated and mutually reinforcing. For instance, access to energy will allow a child to study at night. This energy might come from a solar source and therefore be tackling climate change. In turn, the solar-panel industry might be helping a developing country grow its economy. Greater opportunity to study, in turn, can lead to better job opportunities, innovation, and stronger national institutions.The Goals also have strong links to our efforts to foster international peace and security. It is in countries affected by conflict where so much human need resides. We will not reach the SDGs without renewed resolve to end today's conflicts and violence. When hostilities start, so much else comes to a halt: schooling, vaccination campaigns, economic growth, development itself. At the same time, achieving the goals would help to prevent instability and violence. The new Goals therefore aim to promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies, access to justice and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions. A sustainable world will be a safer one.Making such dramatic improvements in the span of 15 years will be no small feat. Yet we already know that global goal-setting works. The Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000, have improved the lives of millions of people. Global poverty continues to decline; more people have access to improved sources of water; more children than ever are attending primary school; and targeted investments in fighting malaria, AIDS and tuberculosis have saved millions.But much more needs to be done, especially to reach the most marginalized and vulnerable and put us all on a sustainable-development path. The new agenda and Goals embody a commitment to leave no one behind. They are for millennials and grandparents, city dwellers and rural communities, employers and employees, developed and developing countries alike.Just as so many people joined in the process of articulating the SDGs, achieving them requires effort from everyone, everywhere. The United Nations and I look forward to working with people across the world to bring the goals to life and to transform our world. That's the plan; that's the promise; let's get to work!The author is Secretary-General of the United Nations.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post, "What's Working: Sustainable Development Goals," in conjunction with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The proposed set of milestones will be the subject of discussion at the UN General Assembly meeting on Sept. 25-27, 2015 in New York. The goals, which will replace the UN's Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015), cover 17 key areas of development -- including poverty, hunger, health, education, and gender equality, among many others. As part of The Huffington Post's commitment to solutions-oriented journalism, this What's Working SDG blog series has focused on one goal every weekday in September. This post, published on the day the conference is scheduled to start, addresses all the Goals.To find out what you can do, visit here and here.



On Tuesday afternoon, Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk whose imprisonment for not granting same-sex marriage licenses became a cause clbre for the right, was released amid fanfare and a glowing introduction by Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee.

        Conservative Heads Explode Over Kentucky's Bigoted Clerk


"I thought before we left today, maybe you would like to personally express your thanks to the person who has the courage to cause a lot of people to start standing up," Huckabee told a crowd outside the Carter County Detention Center in Grayson, Kentucky. "A person whose courage exceeds that of 99 9/10th percent of the politicians in this country."
As Davis, her husband and attorney strode upon the stage to lock hands, Survivor's ubiquitous 1982 hit "Eye of the Tiger" blasted in the backgroundmusical shorthand for anyonewho's"defied the odds" and struggled as the underdog.
VIDEO
While Davis' supporters applauded the clerk,Frankie Sullivan, the song's co-writer, tells Rolling Stone that neither he nor the band authorized or endorsed Huckabee's use of the song.
"I do not like mixing rock and roll with politics; they do not go hand in hand," Sullivan says. "What upset me most was that, once again, my song was being used to further a political agenda  and no one even bothered to ask for permission."
Sullivan's been down this road before. In 2012, the musician sued then-presidential candidate Newt Gingrichfor using "Eye of the Tiger" as his entrance music at campaign rallies. At the time, Gingrich argued that he was protected under a general ASCAP license, though a lawsuit would have clarified the murky uncertainties endemic to the rules of regulation of music in political campaigns. Sullivan ended up settling with Gingrich under undisclosed terms.
While Sullivan has not decided whether to take legal action against the Huckabee campaign, he tells Rolling Stone the issue is as much personal as it is political.
"I do not agree with Kim Davis' stance and do not believe in denying gay rights and the freedom for all individuals to choose the lifestyle they want to live," Sullivan says. "Our Constitution, and the words of our Founding Fathers, stand tall for freedom, which is what America is all about. I find it ridiculous in this day and age that this fight against gay marriage has gone on, even after the Supreme Court's ruling. Let's stop!"
This is hardly the only fight between musicians and politicians this election. In June, Republican frontrunner (and Rolling Stone cover star) Donald Trump used Neil Young's "Rockin' in the Free World" to kick off his presidential campaign, sparking condemnation from the musician.
"Donald Trump was not authorized to use 'Rockin' in the Free World' in his presidential candidacy announcement," a spokesperson for the rocker's Lookout Management said at the time. "Neil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for President of the United States of America." The Trump campaign told Rolling Stone that they would stop using Young's music in the future.

Pope Francis and President Xi Jinping were both in Washington and New York this week for engagements at the White House and the United Nations. They didn't meet. But their paths certainly crossed. The pope made the moral case for tackling poverty and climate change. President Xi affirmed he will intensify the "reform and opening up" policies that have lifted 500 million people in China out of poverty over the last 30 years -- a feat accomplished more rapidly than any other society in history. And, as the leader of the world's second-largest economy, he pledged to join forces with the U.S. and others to spearhead the global battle against climate change.



Francis' detractors may call him a "communist in a cassock" while Xi's party is Communist in name only, but this alliance of purpose that pairs the prayers of the pope with the formidable state capacity of China could actually move the big needle. (continued)What started as a civil war in Syria nearly five years ago has now evolved into an international crisis unmatched by any other since World War II.

We are here at last -- at the end of one journey, and the beginning of another. Today, after more than three years of negotiations, world leaders will adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Tomorrow, the real work of real implementation begins.Seventeen goals for people, planet, prosperity and peace. Seventeen goals that will apply to every country -- Ivory Coast and Italy; Mongolia and Monaco; Canada and Costa Rica. Seventeen goals that have the potential to transform our world, after being agreed to through the most inclusive and deliberative negotiating process the UN has ever seen.In a world of conflict and violence, a world on the brink of unstoppable climate change, and amidst the biggest refugee crisis since the second World War, the Sustainable Development Goals are a welcome vehicle for hope, change and transformative action. They confront the injustices of poverty, marginalization and discrimination. They recognize the need to reduce inequalities and to protect our common home by changing an economic model so dependent on finite natural resources and on unsustainable consumption. They also identify the overwhelming need to address the politics of division, corruption and irresponsibility that fuel conflict and hold back progress. Yet the slogan that dominated the negotiation phase, "Nothing about us without us," must now become the slogan that defines the implementation phase that lies ahead. After the excitement of this weekend's Summit dies down, the hard work will begin. We must not lose the fantastic momentum we have achieved through the negotiation process and the UN Summit. We need immediate and accelerated action for implementation. As President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, I will be doing my utmost to keep the spotlight on this new Agenda, to drive progress.In 2016, I will hold three high-level events for that very purpose. Starting in April, I want people from all walks of life to gather online and at the UN to demonstrate what they are doing to implement the new goals, and to identify opportunities for partnerships and for action. We need to immediately raise awareness so that these goals are known by everyone and owned by everyone. We need urgent action from everyone because government action alone will not be enough. And, over the course of the next 15 years, we need sustained and strong voices to hold our leaders to account for the commitments they make this weekend.The power and responsibility to ensure that SDG implementation gets off to a good start lies with all of us. Young people will be the torchbearers for these goals, but we all have a role. If we succeed, the next generations will harvest the results of a more peaceful harmonious and sustainable world. If we fail, they will be left with a global environment of more intense and more frequent disasters, devastating conflicts, uncontrolled migration, and fewer resources for human development.We must not let this opportunity pass. Let's work with together to transform our world for the better.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post, "What's Working: Sustainable Development Goals," in conjunction with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The proposed set of milestones will be the subject of discussion at the UN General Assembly meeting on Sept. 25-27, 2015 in New York. The goals, which will replace the UN's Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015), cover 17 key areas of development -- including poverty, hunger, health, education, and gender equality, among many others. As part of The Huffington Post's commitment to solutions-oriented journalism, this What's Working SDG blog series has focused on one goal every weekday in September. This post, published on the day the conference is scheduled to start, addresses all the Goals.To find out what you can do, visit here and here.House Speaker John Boehner on Friday told the House Republican Conference that he plans to resign from Congress at the end of October. Boehner's office said the speaker had planned to exit the office at the end of last year, presumably to usher in former Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Va.). But when Cantor lost his 2014 re-election bid, Boehner stuck around, and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Ca.) took on the majority leader role.


With Boehner out, there are already whispers that McCarthy will take over as speaker of the House -- two sources in leadership circles tell the Huffington Post he's likely to get the gig. Since he may soon become the most powerful Republican in the House, you might as well get to know the guy a little better.


1. Actually, you know him already.


Well, you probably don't know him personally, but you know this guy. He's been on the move since he could crawl, and likely asked his kindergarten classmates for their votes. By the mid-'90s, he was chairman of the California Young Republicans and then moved up to be chairman of the Young Republican National Federation. Meanwhile, he became a Bakersfield district director for Rep. Bill Thomas, chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. From there, he ran to become "Trustee to the Kern Community College District."


2. Nobody dislikes him.


There isn't much to dislike about McCarthy, unless you're annoyed with empty ambition. After his thankless stint on the community college board, he ran in 2002 for California General Assembly and won. He immediately was elected assembly Republican leader -- a position that sounds important. So why'd they give it to a freshman? Assembly Democrats ran the floor with an iron fist and the job was as thankless as they come. Perfect for McCarthy. In 2006, he ran for Congress and won, where he's been running for internal positions since. He served as the whip, a brutally thankless job, from 2011 to 2014, before graduating to majority leader.


3. Nobody likes him.


McCarthy is a likeable guy. But nobody really likes him. What's striking about talking to Republicans about McCarthy is how few are actual supporters, rather than people who would rather he have a job than somebody they like less. It's been working for him his entire political career, though, and politicians have been known to back all the way into the Oval Office. Find us a rabid supporter of George H.W. Bush if you think we're wrong. Being liked is overrated.


4. But sometimes he does the right thing.


McCarthy published a column for conservative Breitbart News last year, but pulled his piece after the site posted Photoshopped images of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosis head on Miley Cyrus body, which was on all-fours. Spokesman Matt Sparks said McCarthy didnt condone the inappropriate" images, saying the congressman felt he did the right thing by asking for the column to be removed.


5. McCarthy won the lottery, and opened a deli with his winnings.


Before he turned 21, McCarthy won $5,000 in the California state lottery. He invested the prize in a sandwich shop, Kevin O's Deli, which he built with his father in their garage. McCarthy sold the deli in 1987. His undergrad degree is in marketing and he got an MBA, both at California State University, Bakersfield.


6. Actor Kevin Spacey shadowed McCarthy for his role in the Netflix series House of Cards.


Spacey plays Francis Underwood, a Democratic representative who for a time served as House majority whip and resorts to murder and extortion to have his way in Washington. The actor shadowed McCarthy on the Hill to prepare for the role, later telling ABC News that McCarthy was very generous to him. The two have become friends, or at least that's the impression in Washington. After watching McCarthy harangue 218 congressman, Spacey said he didnt envy the position. Underwood's office, before he graduated to the Oval Office, was modeled after McCarthy's.


7. He's from Bakersfield, California.


Bakersfield is basically West Texas, but it's just outside Los Angeles, by some accident of geography.




8. He wont ever run for president, if hes playing by his own rules.


McCarthy told MSNBC in November 2014 he didnt think anyone should become president without serving as a governor first. If he stands by those comments, Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul shouldnt expect his support, while New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fits the bill.


9. He helped supermodel Kate Upton celebrate her 21st birthday.


You read that right. McCarthy joined fellow Republican Rep. Fred Upton in wishing the latters niece a happy birthday, posting a photo of the three of them to his Instagram.




10. He's voiced support for amnesty!


Let's pretend for a second that Cantor's 2014 re-election loss actually had to do with his not-complete-opposition to immigration reform. It's a rich irony that McCarthy may be even more forgiving of those without papers than Cantor. He said it was his "personal belief" that a GOP immigration package ought to have a provision to allow someone sin papeles to obtain "legal status that will allow you to work and pay your taxes." Shhhhhh.


11. He's a movie nut.


In 2011, McCarthy showed a scene from the movie "The Town" to motivate his colleagues during a House Republican Caucus meeting on the debt debate.


I need your help. I cant tell you what it is. You can never ask me about it later, and we're gonna hurt some people, Ben Affleck says in the scene.


Whose car are we gonna take? Jeremy Renner replies.


According to GOP aides, then-Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.) responded to the clip by saying, "I'm ready to drive the car."It's often said that worrying doesn't keep any of the bad stuff from happening, it only saps the enjoyment out of the here and now. But whether you're a worrywart or not, most of us will fret -- at times -- over things we have no control over.


The good news is, hindsight, experience and perspective usually help us mellow out as we grow older. And with age, we realize we've wasted far too much time worrying. We asked our Huff/Post 50 Facebookfollowers what it is they wish they hadn't worried about when they were younger. Here are their responses.


1. Worrying about where to go to college/what to major in.




Things have a way of working themselves out in the end. "I never took a journalism course and yet have worked for 42 years as a reporter and editor," our senior writer Ann Brenoff said.


2. Worrying about what others think.


"I wish I'd have had the confidence to be my true self so I could have found out who liked the real me," said reader Angie Mills.


"I wish I hadn't worried about being liked. At a 20th class reunion, I pleasantly discovered I was remembered more fondly than I imagined. I wish I'd been able to enjoy that at the time," said reader Ruth Fisher.


3. Worrying about getting married.




Women, in particular, often feel the pressure to hurry up and get married or risk being "alone" for the rest of their lives. At Huff/Post50, we challenge that, having read numerous stories about peoplefinding love "later in the game."


"I wish I didn't worry so much about whether I would get married 'on time,'" Brenoff said. "I didn't, but I did marry the right guy."


4. Worrying about appearance.


That pimple won't last forever. Your bad haircut will grow out. You don't look fat. There will be good hair days again. One day, you'll look back and realize how good you actually looked.


5. Worrying about fitting in.




Those in your high school clique won't always end up being your lifelong friends. Don't change who you are for them -- or anyone, for that matter. "I wish i hadn't worried about being part of the gang. I should have branched out and been my own gang, I probably would have been better off," said reader Sherry Palmisano.


6. Worrying about having children.


You can't rush nature. And you can't rush love. "I wish I didn't worry about being too old to start a family. I now know that famlies are formed in many different ways. Biology may not always be your friend, but it also doesn't have to defeat you," Brenoff said. When it's meant to be, it'll be.


7. Worrying about not being in control.


To a certain degree, none of us can really control how things will turn out -- at least not completely. But there's one thing most people with life experience will tell you -- you're far more resilient than you think.


"It takes getting older to realize we just are not in charge. All that worry is useless," said reader Susan Wilkie. We couldn't have said it better ourselves.

WASHINGTON -- GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump drew boos from a heavily supportive conservative crowd on Friday after going after opponent and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).


"You have this clown Marco Rubio," he said at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C., before being interrupted by the crowd.


Trump pushed forward, adding a backhanded compliment to Rubio for being true to himself on immigration -- an issue in which there is "nobody weaker," according to the business mogul.


"He's in favor of immigration and he has been -- he has been with the gang of eight and you remember the gang of eight. It was terrible," Trump said, referring to the comprehensive immigration reform bill Rubio helped draftbut has since backed away from.


"And then he went down in the polls," Trump continued. "And you have to say, you know what, if you believe in something you have to be true to yourself. You have to be."


Rubio received a warm reception at the same conference earlier in the day, including a standing ovation when he told the crowd that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) was stepping down.


Trump has ramped up his criticism of Rubio recently, although his aides deny that the candidate feels threatened.


"He doesn't think about Marco Rubio. Marco Rubio doesn't mean anything to him," Trump executive vice president Michael Cohen said earlier Friday on CNN's "New Day."

                WASHINGTON -- Pope Francis urged compassion on Thursday for refugees and unauthorized immigrants, speaking to a crowd that included lawmakers who have said the U.S. should keep out Syrians and others who fled their countries, and should deport more of the undocumented immigrants who are already here.


During an address to the House of Representatives and the Senate, the pope said the solution to the refugee crisis is for other countries to follow the Golden Rule: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."His mention of the Golden Rule earned a standing ovation.


"Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War," he said. "This presents us with great challenges and many hard decisions. On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is this not what we want for our own children?"


He went on to call for people to see refugees and other immigrants as human beings in need of compassion, rather than focus on the resources it would take to help them.


"We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation," Francis said. "To respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome."


The stance isn't new for the pope; he recently called on Catholics in Europe to take in refugees as the continent faces a steady flow of people fleeing Syria and the Middle East. There are nearly 4 million Syrian refugees outside the country, and more than 7.6 million displaced inside, according to the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR.




Some organizations and lawmakers -- including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops -- are calling on President Barack Obama to allow more Syrians to resettle in the U.S., along with more refugees from other countries, of which 70,000 have been admitted in the past few years. The administration announced on Sunday that the refugee admission numberswill go upto 85,000 next fiscal year and 100,000 in the 2017 fiscal year.


But other members of Congressoppose that plan, either for national security reasons -- even though all refugees go through an extensive screening process -- or because they say the U.S. doesn't have the resources.The U.S. already gave more than $4 billion in humanitarian aid, andpledged this weekto give $419 million more.


The pope isn't likely to change all of their minds. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), an ardent opponent of bringing in more refugees or immigrants,told Roll Call on Wednesdaythat he believes Francis isn't sufficiently steeped in immigration law.


"It's always dangerous for church leaders to start opining on complex matters of which they havent had a chance to learn over the years," he said.


Along with refugees, Francis has in the past called for the U.S. to be compassionate to unauthorized immigrants, and in particular the unaccompanied children apprehended along the border in high numbers last year. Hewill meet with some of themduring his trip.


The pope accepted a letter on Wednesday from a5-year-old named Sofi Cruz, who asked him to help undocumented parents of U.S. citizens, like herself.


"The people of this continent are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners," Francis said on Thursday, adding that many people in the room are descended from immigrants. That line drew considerable applause as well.


"When the stranger in our midst appeals to us, we must not repeat the sins and the errors of the past," he said. "We must resolve now to live as nobly and as justly as possible, as we educate new generations not to turn their back on our neighbors and everything around us. Building a nation calls us to recognize that we must constantly relate to others, rejecting a mindset of hostility in order to adopt one of reciprocal subsidiarity, in a constant effort to do our best. I am confident that we can do this."

In un mondo assediato da cos tante sfide, problemi e dispute, il fatto che questa settimana pi di 150 leader internazionali si ritrovino alle Nazioni Unite per dotarsi di una nuova visione per il futuro benessere di tutta l'umanit rappresenta un segno di speranza. Se i leader mondiali si stanno recando a New York  perch capiscono la necessit di orientare il pianeta lungo una rotta pi equa e sostenibile. Al centro di questa nuova agenda si trovano gli obiettivi di sviluppo sostenibile (SDG): 17 traguardi coraggiosi ma raggiungibili che mirano a porre fine alla povert, a lottare contro l'ineguaglianza, ad affrontare i cambiamenti climatici e a costruire societ pacifiche entro l'anno 2030. Questi SDG, altrimenti noti come "Obiettivi globali per lo sviluppo sostenibile", sono il risultato della consultazione pi aperta e trasparente nella storia delle Nazioni Unite, all'interno della quale individui, organizzazioni comunitarie, imprese, scienziati, accademici e altri partner hanno lavorato in collaborazione coi governi. Milioni di persone hanno condiviso la propria visione per un mondo migliore, e i passi necessari a raggiungerla. Il risultato  una vera e propria agenda di popolo. Questi obiettivi sono di natura universale; si applicano a tutti i Paesi, perch sappiamo che anche quelli dotati del maggiore benessere sono ancora lontani dal vincere la povert o dal raggiungere una piena eguaglianza fra i generi. Non c' un obiettivo che sia pi importante degli altri; sono tutti complementari e pi forti nella loro reciprocit. Prendiamo ad esempio l'accesso alla corrente elettrica, che a un bambino pu permettere di studiare anche di sera. Quell'energia potrebbe derivargli da una fonte solare, e di conseguenza si tira in ballo la questione dei mutamenti climatici. A sua volta, un'industria dei pannelli solari sarebbe in grado di aiutare un Paese in via di sviluppo a migliorare la propria economia. E cos migliori opportunit di studio possono a loro volta portare a migliori opportunit di lavoro, innovazione, e istituzioni nazionali pi salde. Questi Obiettivi sono anche fortemente collegati ai nostri sforzi in nome della pace e della sicurezza internazionale.  proprio nei Paesi segnati dai conflitti che si possono individuare tanti bisogni umani. Non saremo in grado di raggiungere gli SDG senza ribadire il nostro intento di porre fine ai conflitti e alle violenze di oggi. Quando cominciano le ostilit, tante altre cose s'interrompono: la scuola, le campagne per le vaccinazioni, la crescita economica e lo stesso sviluppo. Allo stesso tempo il raggiungimento di questi obiettivi contribuirebbe a prevenire instabilit e violenze. I nuovi Obiettivi mirano perci a promuovere societ giuste, pacifiche e inclusive, l'accesso alla giustizia, e istituzioni funzionali, responsabili e inclusive. Un mondo sostenibile sar anche un mondo pi sicuro. Ottenere dei miglioramenti di portata tanto drammatica nel giro di quindici anni non sar impresa da poco. E tuttavia gi sappiamo che stabilire degli obiettivi globali  un metodo che funziona. Gli Obiettivi per lo sviluppo del Millennio, che furono adottati nel 2000, hanno migliorato le vite di milioni di persone. La povert globale continua a decrescere; sempre pi persone si sono viste garantire l'accesso a fonti migliori d'acqua; pi bambini che mai frequentano le scuole elementari; e una serie d'investimenti mirati alla lotta contro la malaria, l'Aids e la tubercolosi hanno salvato milioni di persone. Tuttavia c' molto altro da fare, soprattutto per raggiungere i pi emarginati e vulnerabili, e  per incamminarci tutti lungo una strada per lo sviluppo sostenibile. La nuova agenda e gli Obiettivi rappresentano l'impegno a non lasciarci nessuno dietro. Valgono allo stesso tempo per i millennial e i loro nonni, per gli abitanti delle citt cos come per quelli delle comunit rurali, per i datori di lavoro e i loro impiegati, per i Paesi sviluppati e per quelli in via di sviluppo.Cos come tanti sono stati quelli che hanno contribuito alla formulazione degli SDG, il loro raggiungimento richieder uno sforzo da parte di tutti, ovunque. Le Nazioni Unite e io non vediamo l'ora di poter lavorare con gente di tutto il mondo per realizzare quegli obiettivi e trasformare il pianeta. Quello  il nostro piano; quella  la nostra promessa; mettiamoci al lavoro!L'autore  Segretario Generale delle Nazioni Unite.

PHILADELPHIA (CN) - The constitutionality of conditions at Philadelphia's most populous jail is on trial here in Federal Court.Hundreds of current and former inmates sued the city, challenging conditions at jails run by the Philadelphia Prison System.Lawsuits from six men, representing a cross-section of the larger pool of jail-condition cases, have been selected for trial. The first, each of which is expected to last about two days, began Wednesday.The claims in the case brought by inmate Marcellous Minnick are emblematic of many of the inmate cases.Minnick was convicted of rape in 1998, then arrested on sex charges in 2009, for which he's awaiting sentencing, according to court records.With 3,090 inmates, the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility (CFCF), on 25 acres in northeast Philadelphia, is the largest jail in the six-facility, 8,800-inmate Philadelphia Prison System.Minnick claims that since September 2009, when he entered CFCF as a pretrial detainee, he's been subjected to unconstitutional overcrowding - an allegation that echoes claims by hundreds of other inmates.Hundreds of pretrial detainees say their constitutional rights were violated by the "systematic triple-celling" of inmates - placing three inmates in a cell designed for two.Concomitant to that practice is the use of "boats" - vinyl shells used as a bed in cells housing three people.Those boats, the inmates say, are necessarily placed within inches of the cell toilet, exposing them to urine and fecal pathogens while they sleep.Triple-celling, an attorney for the inmates wrote, "leaves an unconscionably small amount of unencumbered space within the cells," facilitating the spread of infectious disease.It's uncertain how a verdict in Minnick's case, and the other five cases selected for trial, will affect the hundreds of jail-condition lawsuits consolidated before Senior U.S. District Judge Norma Shapiro."These are the first six trial plaintiffs and their cases are being heard on an individual basis," attorney Gerald Williams, of Williams Cuker, said in the courthouse lobby.But the verdicts in those cases could guide Judge Shapiro in deciding how to deal with the remaining lawsuits, and might also spur the City of Philadelphia - the lone defendant in the case - into changing the way it houses inmates.Before opening statements, Judge Shapiro told an 8-person jury, which appears to have no African-Americans on it, "Everybody, even people who are in prison, are entitled to certain standards of behavior."She added: "This is a case that essentially involves overcrowding and its consequences."Attorney Williams, for the inmates, told jurors that the case "is not about the crimes of Marcellous Minnick," who had changed into street clothes and, hands shackled, hobbled into the courtroom before the jury arrived.Williams said that CFCF, where nearly 70 percent of inmates are pretrial detainees, "had more prisoners than it could humanely house.""The triple-celling at CFCF was accompanied by and caused other problems," Williams said.He said the conditions at CFCF were "deplorable," with "rats and mice and vermin running through the cells where people live."Williams said Minnick came to CFCF with a degenerative hip disorder and a hernia, and was not given timely access to medical care."Instead, he was put on the floor of a crowded cell," Williams said, referring to the boats, which he described as "plastic cases in which a mattress is put on the floor."The unsanitary conditions at CFCF caused Minnick to develop dermatitis, Williams said.Amanda Shoffel, an assistant city solicitor, did not deny that triple-celling and boats are used at CFCF. But she said those practices aren't unconstitutional."Nobody wants to triple-cell people. It's not an ideal solution," Shoffel said.But she told the jury, "No one person has to spend an inordinate amount of time in a triple cell."Some factors are beyond the control of jail operators, she said. One is the increase in the number of inmates in the jail system.Shoffel said the city has used "progressive and creative methods and innovations" to deal with Philadelphia's teeming inmate population, which grew from 7,446 inmates in December 2010 to 8,805 inmates on Thursday, July 26, according to figures provided by the Philadelphia Prison System."The question for you is not to determine whether the system is operating in a constant state of perfection," it's to determine whether the conditions Minnick encountered at CFCF were unconstitutional, Shoffel told the jury."The only injury which he is going to allege he received from the prison is a rash," Shoffel said.For the communities living in the Sundarbans, a remote region of islands on the border of eastern India and Bangladesh, a perfect storm of climate changeandextreme poverty has put many thousands of women and children at heightened risk of sex trafficking.


In an effort to push back against the practice, the NGO Save the Children Indiais working with local partners in more than 80 villages in the region to offer classes to the communitys children, PRI's The World reports in a storypublished this week.


According to PRI's Sam Eaton, the classes serve a dual purpose: First, to get the students back on track with formal schooling -- many have dropped out -- and second, to teach them how to keep an eye out for traffickers, alerting their teachers to suspicious people turning up nearby. As a result, the students become a sort of vigilante group protecting their peers.


A number of factors have contributed to theregion becoming a trafficking hub.


The rising sea level in the region -- especially after the devastating Cyclone Aila hit the islandsin 2009 -- has been responsible for repeatedly destroying locals homes and farmland in what Reuters described as "everyday disasters."


The situation has made families increasingly desperate for economic opportunities, causing them to send their children -- both boys and girls -- away tofind work in a city.


In other cases, families ignore their suspicions of attractive young men who arrive in their community promising marriage to their daughters only to later sell them intosex trafficking, Reuters'Aditya Ghosh described in a May 2015 story.


"They are very easily misled by traffickers and agents lurking around, who promise a fantastic life in the cities, the kind that the mainstream media project,"Bankim Hazra, Sundarban Development Boardchairman, explained to Ghosh.

But Save the Children's program is havingresults.

According to PRI, trafficking cases in those villages have been practically eliminated. The group has also set up child protection committees to serve as liaisons between communities and mainland police and are also looking to start community banks to help families finance repairs to flood-damaged homes.

Still, challenges remain and the problem is massive.The practice of trafficking is so widespread in the region that Indias West Bengal state, of which the Sundarbans are a part, is leading the country in reported cases of human trafficking and was home to almost 40 percent of the entire countrys cases, according to a 2013 National Crime Record Bureau report cited by the Indian Express.

As reported by Reuters, over 30,000 adults and children in the regionwere reported missing over the past 10 years of available data, a number considered by victim advocates to be an underestimate because fears of community stigma cause many families not to report their cases to police.

It wasnt always this bad. According to a 2013 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report,West Bengal has seen a 23-fold increase in the number of missing children and a 33-fold increase in missing women between the years 2001 and 2010.

Meanwhile, the West Bengal government plans to help Save the Children scale up its education program to serve more villages, PRI reported. Earlier this summer, the government also announced the creation of a vocational programaimed at helping rescued trafficking victims get back on their feet.

The bipartisan commission, composed of four presidential appointees and four congressional appointees, urged President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to limit immigrant detention as much as possible, particularly for women and children.


"All people, no matter whether they are immigrants or asylum-seekers, deserve to be treated as humans," Chairman Martin R. Castro, a Democrat who was appointed to the commission by Obama, said in a statement.


"Now, more than ever before, we need to treat fairly and humanely those persons, especially women and children, who are seeking sanctuary from violence and instability in their countries," he added.


The report builds on months of backlash to the Obama administration's use of family detention. Opponents have argued for years that immigrant detention, particularly of non-criminals, is overly punitive. Last year, the administration fueled that criticism by deciding to ramp up family detention, and critics are hoping toeventually end the practice altogether.


The USCCR report was approved by a vote of 5-2, with all four Democrats and an Independent voting in favor, and a Republican and an Independent dissenting. (The eighth commissioner recused herself.) Three of the commissioners who voted to approve the findings were appointed by Obama.


The report discusses the commissioners' visits to two detention centers in May: the Port Isabel Detention Center, an adult facility, and Karnes County Residential Center, which holds women and children. In those centers, the commission observed conditions similar to those of prisons, in violation of the civil rights of those inside. Because being in the U.S. without status is a civil, not a criminal, offense, the facilities are supposed to be different from punitive ones, but the report claims that the Department of Homeland Security detains "many undocumented immigrants like their criminal counterparts in violation of a detained immigrants Fifth Amendment Rights."


The panel also alleges that the government is not complying with the Flores settlement, a 1997 agreement that children should be detained in the least restrictive setting possible. A judge ruled in July that the government was violating that settlement. DHS is appealing the ruling, but the commission argues that the department should stop its appeal and follow the order by immediately releasing the families.


However, the report does acknowledge the administration'sresponseto the ruling, in which the government argued that it is already making reforms to family detention, including releasing mothers and children at a quicker rate except under extreme circumstances, and is therefore not violating the Flores settlement.




The report states that DHS is violating detainees' civil rights and due process rights, in part by failing to provide them with adequate access to lawyers -- people in immigration proceedings have no guaranteed right to an attorney -- and information. In addition, the commissioners allege that DHS does not do enough to prevent and combat sexual abuse in the facilities, and say the agency should establish better procedures for reporting and make sure detainees who speak languages other than English and Spanish can communicate with officers.


Along with releasing family detainees, the commission recommends that the government use alternatives to detention more often when they could be monitored in less restrictive ways, such as bond or supervised release. It also advises Congress to put more money into alternatives to the detention facilities and to end a mandate that DHS maintain at least 34,000 detention beds.


Marsha Catron, a spokeswoman for DHS, said the agency is reviewing the commission's report:

DHS takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care. The Department is committed to ensuring that individuals housed in our all of our centers have the proper care and appropriate resources, that they are held and treated in a safe, secure and humane manner, and that their civil and due process rights are respected. We have consistently improved and updated our standards and policies to reflect this commitment.

Recognizing the sensitive and unique nature of detaining families, we have made significant changes to the family residential facilities. Of note, we are transitioning these facilities into short-term processing centers where individuals who claim fear of return to their countries can be interviewed for asylum and other humanitarian protections. Families who establish a credible or reasonable fear of persecution will be released under conditions designed to ensure their compliance with their immigration obligations.

The report was released the same day that members of Obama's party delivered their own rebuke of family detention: a bill from Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with the Democrats, that seeks to end the use of private prison companies.Like the USCCR report, the bill recommends ending family detention and using alternatives more frequently, as well as eliminating the mandate to maintain 34,000 beds.


USCCRhas shown its support for immigrant-friendly policies in the past, including by commending Obama for his deportation relief programs last year. Commission member Gail Heriot, an Independent, suggested in her dissent to Thursday's report that the commissioners started out with a bias against family detention.


Heriot's dissentaccuses the majority of relying too much on hearsay and news reports. She recounted her own observations of the facilities they visited and gave a far more favorable analysis, calling into question the veracity of the claims made about sexual assaults and other abuses reported.


"The Commission thus went into this project intent on uncovering a scandal," Heriot said. "Instead of conducting an actual investigation, it structured its initial fact-finding simply to amplify stale rumor and innuendo. No effort was undertaken to establish whether the allegations -- all of which were already public -- were fact or fancy."

A former adviser who remains close to the vice president said Biden is weighing his wife's comfort with a run and the conduct of the Clinton campaign as he finalizes his decision. His final choice on whether to run, according to a Democratic fundraiser who has met with Biden aides, will likely come in late September. However, another prominent Democratic fundraiser who has raised money for Biden in the past suggested that an entry could come as late as early October, in the weeks leading up to the first Democratic debate.
Biden's ultimate decision is complicated by delicate, emotionally raw family dynamics. According to the former adviser, who requested anonymity to speak openly, Jill Biden remains hesitant about a campaign as she continues to grieve the death of Beau Biden, who died in May at the age of 46. Beau reportedly encouraged his father to make a third run at the presidency before his death, and the vice president sees the possible campaign as a vehicle to promote Beau's legacy and the issues he cared about.



Beyond family misgivings, Biden is also waiting to see how the current Democratic primary process plays out. It's not just Hillary Clinton's trouble shaking criticism over her use of a private email account while secretary of state that he's watching.Biden has also expressed concerns in conversations with fellow Democrats that Clinton won't be able to effectively push issues like economic inequality, owing to her time at the Clinton foundationand the paid speeches she's given since leaving the State Department.




For weeks now, Democratic officials had assumed that talk of a run from inside Biden's orbit was merely an effort to keep options open should a Clinton candidacy fall apart. But in recent days, the chatter has grown louder and more specific, with inquiries being made into how a campaign structure could be put together and how much money could be raised. Speculation hit a near fever pitch this past weekend, after the vice president met Saturday with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has yet to endorse in the primary.


Supporters are paving the way for Biden to jump into the race, with the Draft Biden campaign building up a grassroots network and raising funds. And on Monday, the Washington Post reportedthat major Democratic fundraisers were invited to meet with Biden at his residence.


But the extent of support out there isn't entirely clear, as a good chunk of the big donors are committed to Clinton. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, has soaked up large chunks of the party's grassroots financial backing and could lay claim to having elevated economic inequality as a focus for months before Biden entered the race.


"Maybe he can peel off some donors on the left, maybe unions, but I dont know who is out there," said one of the aforementioned Democratic fundraisers.


Still, the prospect of a Biden run has put White House officials in a bind. Many Obama aides have already signed up to help with the Clinton campaign, and there is little apparent evidence at this juncture that there will be a bolt to the vice president should he enter. Indeed, Clinton confidantes have stressed that they believe her email troubles will likely fade over time. They are eagerly awaiting her Oct. 22testimony before the House committee investigating the Benghazi consulate attack of 2011.


Inside the White House, officials have tried not to show any leanings between the two officials. White House press secretary Josh Earnest had kind words for Biden on Monday, saying it was not out of the question that President Barack Obama could endorse one of the Democratic candidates.


"There is probably no one in American politics today who has a better understanding of exactly what is required to mount a successful national presidential campaign," said Earnest.

The date of birth noted on the document was Jan. 4, 2015. The child was only 11 days old.The American Immigration Lawyers Association, a 13,000-member group that has done extensive work representing women and children who fled Central American countries for the United States, filed a brief on June 2 telling a similar story of a 3-year-old boy from Honduras. According to Customs and Border Protection documents provided to HuffPost by the attorneys, the boy stated that he was coming to the U.S. to seek employment.
Included in the documents is a transcript of an interview, conducted in Spanish and translated to English. The questions are apparently being addressed to the little boy -- for example, "Are your parents also natives and citizens of Honduras?" -- and there is no indication that the child's mother or anyone else is answering for him. On the final page, the border patrol agent reports that he asked the 3-year-old why he left his native country, and the child responded, "To look for work." The AILA brief, which was filed in a separate deportation case, argues that the interview "almost certainly never happened in the format in which it was memorialized." The boy's alleged statement about looking for work is significant because an undocumented individual's chances of remaining in the U.S. often hinge on his or her motivation for coming to the country without authorization. More than 68,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended in the last fiscal year along the U.S.-Mexico border, along with roughly the same number of family groups. Many of them have sought asylum and said they were fleeing violence and abuse in their native countries. Those coming to the U.S. to seek work are far more likely to be deported.The removal case against the 11-day-old infant was thrown out in March because of lack of evidence and the fact that the mother says the baby was born in the U.S., immigration attorney Bridget Cambria said. But the infant and the toddler aren't the only children who have been listed as looking for work on official forms from Customs and Border Protection, and immigration attorneys contend that such slip-ups are part of a broader problem. They say that some border agents are failing to do the screening required to ensure that children and other migrants are not deported back into dangerous situations. "If you list the incorrect information or you don't honor a fear, that ends up with severe consequences," Cambria said. Border agents are supposed to conduct a screening process in which they ask whether an individual is fearful about returning to his or her home country. If the person says yes, that claim is later scrutinized by an asylum officer and then an immigration judge. But immigration lawyers and advocates say that many people are either not being asked that question or having their claims of fear not noted in the record. (The 3-year-old boy referenced in the AILA filing also allegedly said he is afraid of returning to his country.)Inconsistencies between border agents' documents and what individuals later say in court can hurt a person's ability to obtain asylum, said attorney Stephen Manning, who co-authored the amicus filing."Inaccuracies or false statements or made-up information in there comes back to undermine an individual's credibility, where they say, 'Look, you said this before but now you're saying this,'" Manning explained. The child, who is now 4 years old, has been living in detention for nearly a year and is currently at a facility in Karnes City, Texas, with his mother, according to their lawyer Daniel Thomann. They both applied for relief from deportation -- the child filed for asylum and his mother filed for withholding of removal -- but they were denied and are now appealing. Although the boy was approved for release on bond, his mother was not, so they remain in the detention center, Thomann said. The mother had tried to enter the U.S. before and insists that she was not asked at that time if she was afraid to return to Honduras, Thomann said. But there are Customs and Border Protection documents claiming she was asked and responded she was not afraid. Thomann said he brought up the alleged transcript of her child's interview to make the point that documents provided by border agents are not reliable."If they're not paying enough attention to separate the fact that obviously this child is not looking for work, what else are they just glossing over?" he said.The issue goes beyond children. A Human Rights Watch report from last October found that very few people from Central America were flagged as potential asylum seekers by border agents.Clara Long, the author of that report, said Tuesday that she has seen evidence that some people who express fear are not referred to asylum officers. She said she had seen another case of a 3-year-old boy who also supposedly said he came to the U.S. to seek work. When advocates bring such cases to the attention of Customs and Border Protection officials, Long said they aren't getting an adequate response. "CPB has just fallen down on the job," she said. "They're just refusing to recognize how serious a problem this is." An official with Customs and Border Protection said they were actively reviewing the filing information before commenting on the matter.As for the 11-day-old baby who allegedly planned to seek employment in Dodge City, her job prospects might have been somewhat limited. According to Babycenter.com, most week-old babies can only see things that are quite close to their faces. Many lines of work would be difficult for an 11-day-old because the remains of the umbilical cord have yet to drop off. BabyCenter lays out for new mothers this list of skills for the average 2-week-old baby -- who would be significantly older, in relative terms, than the suspected Dodge City job seeker:Your womb was a warm and cozy environment, and it'll take time for your baby to adjust to the various sights, sounds, and sensations of life outside your body. You may not be able to detect much of a personality just yet, as your baby spends his time moving in and out of several different states of sleepiness, quiet alertness, and active alertness.The only way your baby knows to communicate is by crying, but you can communicate with him through your voice and your touch. (Your baby can now recognize your voice and pick it out among others.)Your baby probably loves to be held, caressed, kissed, stroked, massaged, and carried. He may even make an "ah" sound when he hears your voice or sees your face, and he'll be eager to find you in a crowd.Fear not, American worker.Ryan Grim contributed reporting. On Saturday night's episode of "Oprah: Where Are They Now?", former child star Danny Pintauro revealed that he has been living with a big secret for more than a decade: He is HIV-positive.


Everyone remembers the young, blond-haired Pintauro as Jonathan on the family sitcom "Who's the Boss?" For eight years, Pintauro played the son of a driven single mother, winning over audiences with his nerdy charm. But, in the years after "Who's the Boss?" ended, the once-lighthearted little boy grew into a complicated young man trying to live a private life in the public eye.


In his sit-down with Oprah, Pintauro -- who goes by "Daniel" now -- begins the interview by sharing his long-held secret.


"I wanted to tell you this a long time ago, but I wasn't ready. I'm ready now," Pintauro says. "I'm HIV-positive, and I have been for 12 years."


Part of why Pintauro hadn't spoken publicly about his health before, he says, is because he wasn't sure if people were ready for a conversation of this magnitude. "It's just a big deal, you know? It's not something that people are really talking about right now," Pintauro says.



   George Burns/Harpo   This isn't the first time Pintauro has revealed a private detail about his personal life. In 1997, when he was a college student, Pintauro came out as gay -- but he hadn't exactly planned to. "I was outed," Pintauro says. "It wasn't by choice."


The actor says that a tabloid reporter called him back then saying the paper was going to out him whether he cooperated or not. His former "Who's the Boss?" co-star, Judith Light, encouraged Pintauro to participate as a way of controlling the conversation. "It was the best thing," Pintauro says now. "'They can't misquote you,' she said. 'And as long as you give really responsible and mature answers, it can't be a bad article.'"


And, as Pintauro realized, it wasn't. "Believe it or not, the 'National Enquirer' actually did a really fantastic, heartwarming article about it," he says. "I was shocked."



   Ron Galella, Ltd. via Getty Images   Pintauro says he regularly underwent routine HIV testing every six months. Then, in March of 2003, his whole world changed.


"I was living in New York at the time and completely clueless to the idea that I was positive. I went in for a regular checkup," Pintauro says. "It was just regular blood work. You go in, and you sort of waited two weeks on pins and needles -- or at least I did, because I was just terrified of the idea of getting HIV."


Having come out of a two-year relationship, Pintauro admits later in the interview that he had been looking to explore more sexually and began using crystal meth as a means to that end. "I was doing crystal meth, which completely ruins your immune system. I'd been doing it at that point very briefly, but it was three weeks or so, off and on," he explains. "I had just come out of a two-year relationship, and I discovered in that relationship that there was more I wanted to explore sexually. Crystal meth takes away your inhibitions... And if you want to explore that adventurous side, taking the drug is going to put you there.


"I was experimenting," he continues. "And believe it or not, I thought that I was being safe in that encounter. I know exactly when it happened."


Though Pintauro doesn't go into those details, he does say that he doesn't remember the man's name. "I regret not knowing that, because that person has completely changed my life," he says.
Even though antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) had been introduced by the time Pintatuo was diagnosed, dramatically increasing the lifespan of those with HIV and reducing their risk of transmitting the infection to others, Pintauro was still devastated by his diagnosis. He struggled to make sense of his feelings.

"It was terrifying, and there was a sense of relief," he says. "It's backwards. You've spent so much time terrified that you're going to get it, and then you have it. You don't have to be terrified anymore."

Today, Pintauro lives with his husband, Wil Tabares,in Las Vegas, and works as a restaurant manager. He told Oprah that his dreams in life are to open a bed and breakfast with Tabares, live a long life and be a beacon of light that can help make a difference to others along the journey. Pintauro also shared an important message for other men in the gay community.
